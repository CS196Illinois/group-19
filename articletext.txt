(CNN) - The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, is overseeing the Peachtree PAC, a new political action committee that emerged in recent days to shape the US Senate runoffs in Georgia, officials tell CNN.The group will spend $43 million in new television and radio ad spending. That's on top of the roughly $80 million that the McConnell-aligned political organization already has committed to spend through the Senate Leadership Fund and American Crossroads, another super PAC."The fate of our country hangs in the balance in Georgia," Senate Leadership Fund President Steven Law said in a statement to CNN. "This new activity through Peachtree PAC will articulate the stakes couldn't be higher as the future of freedom (is) on the ballot."His statement came after CNN inquired about the Peachtree PAC and its shared media buyer with the Senate Leadership Fund.Peachtree will begin its advertising blitz Wednesday, reservations show.The January 5 runoffs -- pitting Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue against Democrats challengers Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff -- will determine whether Republicans retain their Senate majority next year. The twin races have drawn staggering sums already: Television and advertising spending had approached $400 million as of Tuesday, according to the latest data from Kantar's Campaign Media Analysis group. So far, Republicans lead Democrats in spending by about $242.4 million to $154.3 million.The tally includes spending since November 10 and reservations through the January 5 runoffs.Peachtree's burst of activity reflects the rise of pop-up super PACs, political action committees with local-sounding names that emerge to influence individual contests without making clear to voters their ties to national groups or the sources of their funding.A national Democratic super PAC, the Senate Majority PAC, launched two super PACs active in the Georgia contests: The Georgia Way and Georgia Honor. Together, those two groups have spent about $17 million in the runoffs, according to Kantar data.Using misleading super PAC names allows national party interests to "launder the money and launder the message" in local races, said Brendan Fischer of the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center.The surge in activity by the Peachtree PAC already has made it one of the top spenders in Georgia.The Peachtree PAC filed its statement of organization with the Federal Election Commission on November 6 -- as the two runoffs came into focus.

But he also inherits a Democratic Party that is divided on how to tackle a wide array of issues, from immigration to health care, criminal justice to defense. Can they come together to confront a possible Republican Senate? Can they deliver on their mandate without further alienating the voters they lost? In this week's "What Comes Next," David Axelrod, former adviser to President Barack Obama, and Jess McIntosh, a Democratic strategist, tackle those questions in our discussion. But first, here's Axelrod's op-ed on what comes next for the Democratic Party. --SE CuppIf you're a Democrat, this is a time of great relief but not necessarily much joy.Sure, you captured the big prize, defeating a president with autocratic tendencies whose continuation in office many feared -- with good reason -- posed an existential threat to the institutions, norms and rule of law that form the foundation of our democracy.Joe Biden won the support of more than 80 million Americans, marking the seventh time in eight elections that Democrats have claimed the national popular vote. He added five states Hillary Clinton lost in 2016, including two -- Arizona and Georgia -- where Democrats had not won at the presidential level since the 1990s.All good news.But beneath that glittering top line, Republicans had an unexpectedly good Election Day.Encouraged by polling that proved too rosy, Democrats had high hopes of seizing a US Senate majority, enlarging their edge in the US House of Representatives and taking control of a half dozen or more legislatures across the country -- critical in a year when the states will be redrawing legislative and congressional maps for the next decade.None of that happened.While Biden won the presidency, it was Donald Trump who had the coattails. Mired in scandal, controversy and an epic pandemic, Trump, nevertheless, won over 74 million votes -- over 10 million more votes then he received in 2016. While it wasn't enough to save the embattled president, Republicans swept along in his wake narrowed the Democratic advantage in the US House by at least 12 seats so far, captured control of two more state legislative chambers in New Hampshire and are favored to maintain the majority in the US Senate, pending two critical runoff elections in Georgia on January 5.Unless Democrats can pull off two upsets in Georgia, many of Biden's appointments and much of his agenda will be at the mercy of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Senate Republicans, quickly testing the incoming president's oft-stated hope for a new era of bipartisan cooperation.Trump soon will be gone, but he has turbocharged a realignment, decades in the making, that leaves us a more deeply divided country and raises challenges for both parties.Buoyed by significant gains among suburban voters, and strong showings in cities, Biden won many of the most populous and prosperous metropolitan areas by even larger margins than Hillary Clinton. But Trump commanded more than 80% of the nation's counties, dominating rural areas and small towns across large swaths of the country.Those divisions, and the constitutionally-mandated system by which we elect presidents and apportion senators and members of Congress, means that Democrats may have the most voters, but Republicans, by activating their base, can maintain legislative power and remain competitive in future Electoral College races for the White House.  For Democrats, the sobering reality is that, despite his seven million vote-lead nationally, Biden captured the presidency by a combined 43,692 votes across three battleground states. Without his narrow wins in Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin, the race for electoral votes would have been tied.  And, looking back, Biden was likely the only Democrat running in 2020 who could have pulled it off.White-haired, White and male; steeped in the working-class culture of his native Scranton, Pennsylvania; moderate in tone and politics and enormously empathetic because of his own horrific life struggles, Biden was a difficult target for the race-baiting, reactionary president.While Trump may have wounded Democratic candidates down ballot with his caricature of the party as a hotbed of "the radical left, "socialists," and mob-coddling advocates of "defunding police," he failed to brand Biden, who exit polls say carried moderate voters by 30 points, nearly three times Clinton's margin over Trump four years ago.That shift was reflected in the suburbs, where burgeoning turnout and shifting allegiances made the difference in the battleground states. Weary of chaos, and comfortable with Biden, White men with a college degree, who heavily favored Trump over Clinton in 2016, were nearly tied this year. White women with a college degree favored Biden by nearly double digits, according to CNN exit polls.These gains more than offset losses among some groups on whom Democrats were counting. African-Americans still supported Biden in overwhelmingly numbers, but Trump made small but measurable gains with Black men. Moreover, Democrats, who counted Latinx voters among their base, learned that Hispanic-American communities can't be treated as a monolithic or an automatic vote. They are rich and varied in their perspectives and experiences, and bucked the Democratic Party in places like Miami-Dade County in Florida and parts of South Texas. The decline among Asian-Americans was also noticeable. But the biggest concern Democrats should have is over the hardening of opposition in large swaths of America that may send us into perpetual gridlock.It's too easy and self-defeating for Democrats in this big, diverse country to write off these Republican-won voters or regions, and too facile to explain their loss solely in terms of the issue of race, despite Trump's relentless and unabashed race-baiting and nativism.Many of the small towns and rural communities between the coasts where Republicans have built their fortress have been battered and depleted by the same economic change that has benefited burgeoning metropolitan areas, where Democrats have prospered electorally.Trump's anti-trade, anti-immigrant, anti-environmental, law-and-order jeremiads have found an audience in these communities, exploiting and inflaming a sense that Democrats are disdainful of their values and alien to their economic interests.  If Democrats are seen only as a coalition of economic and cultural elites and minorities -- with little connection to the rest of the country -- the party may still win narrow national victories, as they did in 2020, but will struggle to win and maintain governing majorities.Democrats need an expansive, authentic economic message for these changing times that speaks to the experience of tens of millions of Americans, rural and urban, who feel that the system devised over time by experts from Wall Street to Washington DC is rigged against them. Biden's emphasis on boosting jobs and wages, reducing inequality and undergirding the middle class is a step in the right direction.Yet in pursuing other bedrock commitments, Democrats need to pay some attention to how their words and plans are heard and how their actions are read across the whole country.Take climate change, which is an existential crisis that demands urgent action. But if you work on an oil field, extract natural gas or coal from the ground or lay pipeline for living, the moral argument about the next generation comes hard up against anxiety about the next paycheck.  In pursuing climate action, those concerns should be honored and addressed, not dismissed. Systemic racism is a brutal reality that millions of our fellow Americans confront in different ways on a daily basis. Black Americans have faced uniquely unconscionable hardships, brutality and withering economic barriers from the beginning of the republic to this day. It is a legacy we, as a country, must confront and redress. But people in struggling rural communities and aging industrial towns who aren't subject to racial discrimination but have been caught in the switches of a changing economy need to know Democrats are fighting for them, too.And then there is immigration, an issue Trump has relentlessly exploited to divide and inflame. This is a nation of hard-working immigrants whose arrival on our shores, generation after generation, has enriched our country.  Now, as they seek to fix a broken and shamefully inhumane system, Democrats should also assure there are rules and accountability to address concerns of blue-collar workers who fear that a surge of immigrants will undercut their jobs and wages.As Trump has proven again, presidents define their parties. For Democrats, that task now falls to Biden, who will take over amid a raging pandemic that has wreaked havoc on our economy in a country whose trust in institutions has been shaken to the core.  With divided government, Biden will have to deal not only with implacable Republicans but his own fractious coalition, mediating between a left averse to compromise, minorities demanding their rightful place at the table and suburban moderates who are an increasingly important element of the Democratic base. Gone but not forgotten, Trump will likely launch the resistance from Day One, and will be abetted by a right-wing media ecosystem long on conspiracy theories and short on facts, stoking the red-blue divide.Biden may have been the only Democrat in the race who could have defeated Trump in 2020.  But now the oldest president in history faces a Herculean task, not only in leading the country, but growing his party for the futureNew York  (CNN Business) - Newsmax TV has notched a ratings win over Fox News Channel for the very first time.The win, fueled by conservative viewers who are disappointed by the election results, happened Monday evening. In the key 25- to 54-year-old demographic prized by advertisers, "Greg Kelly Reports" on Newsmax out-rated "The Story with Martha MacCallum" on Fox.The margin was narrow — Kelly averaged 229,000 viewers in the demo and MacCallum averaged 203,000 — but it is still a milestone in the cable news industry.Before the election, Newsmax was not regarded as a formidable competitor to Fox; it was mostly dismissed as one of a handful of wannabe challengers.But President Trump's loss on November 3 changed the cable TV calculus. Viewers who were frustrated when Fox admitted the truth of Trump's loss sought other options. Trump encouraged them to try Newsmax.Newsmax — and Kelly in particular — offered a safe space in which Biden was not called president-elect and Trump was not yet defeated.Through the post-election weeks in November, as Trump's legal team suffered dozens of losses in court in its attempt to overturn the results, Kelly insisted that he believed Trump would still prevail.His 7 p.m. program consists of long, pro-Trump, anti-media commentaries of the type typically found later in the evening on Fox. And a certain subset of viewers are rewarding him for it. Kelly's show is usually Newsmax's highest-rated show of the day."We're here to stay," Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy said Tuesday evening. "The ratings are showing that."Fox News is still four times higher-rated than Newsmax at any given time of day, according to Nielsen. Among viewers of all ages, Fox averaged 1.36 million viewers around the clock on Monday, while Newsmax averaged 316,000 viewers.But Fox is down from its pre-election highs while Newsmax is way up.Take Kelly's hour: Before the election, his show barely had a heartbeat. The 7 p.m. hour had barely 10,000 viewers in the 25-54 demo and 100,000 viewers overall, according to Nielsen data.Now the hour has nearly a million viewers on a good night, and Monday was good: 949,000 viewers.Ruddy pointed out that Newsmax TV is also live-streamed on a variety of platforms, so there is an additional audience that is not measured by Nielsen. In the 7 p.m. hour, Newsmax ranked third overall, behind CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront," which averaged 423,000 viewers in the demo on Monday, and MSNBC's "The ReidOut," which had 280,000.The 25-54 demo is critical because most advertising on cable news networks is bought and sold using demographic ratings.Newsmax seems to be cutting into Fox's demo performance at some other times of day, though it's hard to say for sure.At 4 p.m. on Monday, for example, "The Howie Carr Show" on Newsmax averaged 101,000 in the demo, while "Your World with Neil Cavuto" on Fox averaged 148,000 in the demo.One hour later, the gap between the two channels was much wider: "The Chris Salcedo Show" on Newsmax averaged 120,000 while "The Five" on Fox attracted 303,000.What's the main difference? "The Five" is an intense right-wing talk show while Cavuto's 4 p.m. hour is less ideological. Fox's more opinionated shows outperform its newscasts, even when the newscasts are stacked with conservative guests and storylines.Newsmax maxes out on talk shows, not newscasts. In the coming weeks, Ruddy said, Newsmax will continue to expand its programming schedule, including a 10 p.m. program led by Rob Schmitt, a former early morning host on Fox.Ruddy is still brainstorming options for the 9 p.m. hour.It must be emphasized that Fox is still far ahead of Newsmax by almost every conceivable metric.But Fox is accustomed to being No. 1 in the 25-54 demo so losing to Newsmax, even for one hour of one day, is a serious shock.Fox Corp. chief financial officer Steve Tomsic addressed the competition at a financial conference earlier in the day Tuesday. He mentioned Newsmax and One America News by name."I think when people think about competition, they sort of, their knee jerk reaction is to think, 'well all we need is two or three talking heads to go head to head with ours.' The business is much bigger than that," Tomsic said, including news coverage and digital properties.He described Fox News as a business "that has stood the test of time, and every time there's been skepticism about what the future looks like, we've pierced through and hit another high.""So," he said, "we feel super confident about Fox News being able to compete in any environment going forward."(CNN) - A Royal Caribbean cruise ship has returned to port in Singapore after a passenger tested positive for Covid-19.The Quantum of the Seas ship was hosting a three-night, four-day "cruise to nowhere" itinerary around Singapore. The cruise was part of a much-vaunted program to reinvigorate domestic travel in Singapore amid the coronavirus pandemic. Royal Caribbean has confirmed to CNN that a passenger on board the ship tested positive for the virus after checking in with a member of the ship's medical staff. Upon the confirmed positive test, the Quantum of the Seas informed Singaporean officials of the news and returned to port. Guests will not be permitted to disembark from the ship until full contact tracing measures have been carried out. "We worked closely with the government to develop a thorough system that tests and monitors all guests and crew and follows public health best practices," a Royal Caribbean representative said. "That we were able to quickly identify this single case and take immediate action is a sign that the system is working as it was designed to do."Annie Chang, director of cruise at the Singapore Tourism Board, told The Straits Times that all of the infected passenger's close contacts have tested negative for the coronavirus but will be isolated as a precautionary measure."The well-being and safety of our local community, as well as passengers and crew remain a top priority. All passengers undergo a mandatory Covid-19 test prior to boarding, with stringent hygiene and safety measures implemented throughout their passenger journey," she added.The ship was operating at 50% capacity. All passengers had to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test in order to board and wear masks at all times when outside their staterooms. Only Singaporean citizens were allowed to buy tickets for the cruise, and crew members from around the world spent 14 days quarantining in the city-state in order to be cleared for working.As an extra hygiene measure, fresh air was regularly cycled throughout the ship, Royal Caribbean said. The Quantum of the Seas debuted in 2015 to much fanfare. On-board amenities include bumper cars, a bionic bar with iPad ordering, a skydiving simulator and 19 restaurants, including one with an "Alice in Wonderland" theme. It cost $1 billion to build and outfit. (CNN) - In early November, Wilma Gail Bowen and Willard Bowen mourned the loss of Willard's mother, who had died from dementia and Covid-19 complications. Three weeks later, on Thanksgiving Day, the Georgia couple died of Covid-19, just hours apart from each other.The couple, who had known each other since high school and celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary in September, likely caught the virus visiting Willard's mother, said the couple's daughter, Karen Kirby.The couple spent a little over a week in the hospital in the intensive care unit. Once Wilma realized her husband might not ever get to return home, her daughter said her condition immediately worsened."I honestly think she knew she couldn't live life without him," Kirby said. "They were just so in touch and in tune with each other."Originally in adjacent rooms, the couple was so worried about one another that a nurse sought permission to treat them both in the same room, a rarity in the ICU."She got special permission to take care of them together so they would not have to be apart," Kirby said. "Their job is hell right now and I know that, but they helped to make my closure just a little bit better."The couple had deep ties to their community in Paulding County, a once rural area that is now one of Atlanta's suburbs.Wilma, despite being 70 years old, was a school nurse in Paulding County, foregoing retirement to spend more time caring for the students she lovingly referred to as "her kids.""Other school nurses said, 'Your mom works circles around us even though she's older than we are,'" Kirby said.Willard, 73, was an avid antique collector, known around town as the neighborhood antique dealer, always looking to repurpose. Before the couple contracted the virus, they had sold their house and were planning on moving into a new home. When their daughter's "village" of friends were packing up the old house, people immediately recognized items Willard bought from their garage sales.Though the couple never got to move into their new home, Kirby said she's grateful her friends were there to help her with the move."That was God's way of not making me dwell on all of those things," she saidPaulding County has suffered multiple coronavirus outbreaks, prompting on and off school closures. In a letter sent to the school community last week, one of the county's elementary schools announced a switch to remote learning after "a large number" of staff and student quarantines. The school district did not respond to requests for comment.Having lost her grandmother and her parents in a month, Kirby is now urging people to understand the severity of the pandemic, and to reach out to loved ones accordingly."I had no inkling two weeks ago that I would be burying my parents. I just want people to take the time to reach out and love one another," she said. "That's what Mama and Daddy would've done."(CNN) - The progressive uprising against a wide range of potential Joe Biden administration nominees reflects not only old ideological divisions among Democrats but also a new struggle over how the incoming president should advance his objectives in a closely divided Washington. Many of the centrist potential Biden appointments who have drawn the most fire from the left -- including Rahm Emanuel, a former Chicago mayor and former White House chief of staff for Barack Obama; former Bill Clinton policy director Bruce Reed; and former Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota -- have long records of negotiating deals with Republicans and conservative-leaning business and other interest groups. For that reason, the opposition to such potential appointees is becoming a proxy war for a much larger dispute among Democrats about how Biden can navigate a narrowly divided Washington in which Democrats at best will control only 50 seats in the Senate and no more than about 222 in the House. Moderate Democrats believe Biden needs appointees with the experience and inclination to build coalitions for his ideas that include Republicans and business groups beyond the party base."Joe Biden ... won the Democratic nomination and the presidency because he was a moderate and, frankly, because he could work with the other side," says Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, a centrist Democratic group. "That wasn't a bug, that was a feature, and I expect that the majority of the people in his Cabinet are going to be those who can work with the other side." But many on the left say that trying to advance Biden's agenda by negotiating compromises with a sliver of Republicans, especially in the Senate, is a fool's errand in an era so polarized that hardly any of them will even publicly acknowledge that he has won. Instead, they want him to mobilize public support for his proposals -- and to target congressional Republicans as obstructionists if they block them. And for that, they say, Biden needs appointees more inclined to sharpen than to smooth differences with the GOP. "Democrats will face a fork in the road when it comes to the issue of bipartisanship," says Adam Green, co-founder of the liberal Progressive Change Campaign Committee. "On many issues, a majority of Republican voters support a position that zero Republican politicians in Washington are willing to vote for. At that moment does bipartisanship mean cutting an unpopular deal with corrupt out-of-touch politicians like [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell? Another option is rally the public and ... we hope that's where [Biden] goes." Objections from the leftThe left's agitation over potential Biden nominees is only one of the many crosswinds buffeting his selection process. Biden has also faced sustained pressure to ensure diversity in his picks, both in terms of gender and race. Insiders say the selection process has also been marked by frustration among some that so many of the key positions have gone to veterans of the Obama administration, such as Jeffrey Zients and Brian Deese, top Obama economic officials whom Biden has named, respectively, to coordinate the response to the coronavirus outbreak and lead the White House's National Economic Council.But the pressure from the left has been unique in that it's been focused at least as much on blocking potential appointees as on elevating them. A loose constellation of social-media savvy groups that includes Justice Democrats, the political organization affiliated with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and the rest of "The Squad," the Revolving Door Project at the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, Demand Progress, which focuses on government reform and internet regulation, and the Sunrise Movement, which organizes young people on climate change, have publicly objected to a substantial list of potential nominees. Other organizations have mobilized against specific targets on a more ad hoc basis.The possible nominees who have faced public resistance from the left include Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo (who was considered a favorite for the Health and Human Services secretary position but announced last week that she would stay in her post), Heitkamp (who has been floated as a potential agriculture secretary), Michael Connor (a deputy interior secretary under Obama discussed for the top job now) and Neal Katyal (an Obama acting solicitor general floated for various top Justice Department jobs). Black Lives Matter protesters have gathered outside Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti's home for weeks demanding that Biden not select him for any top position. Deese's appointment to the National Economic Council also drew some liberal fire. Amid all this agitation, liberal groups have mobilized perhaps most intently against potential positions for Emanuel and Reed. (I've known and reported on each of them since Clinton's first presidential campaign in the early 1990s.) Liberal publications have argued in vitriolic terms against any position for Emanuel, and Justice Democrats circulated a petition (eventually signed by Ocasio-Cortez and other "Squad" members) opposing Reed's possible appointment as director of the Office of Management and Budget as "a major test for the fight for the soul of the Biden presidency." (The nomination eventually went to Neera Tanden, the former top domestic policy adviser to Hillary Clinton and president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.) The bill of particulars against each of these potential nominees varies. Many face complaints that outside of government, they have worked for corporate clients. Environmental and left-leaning farm groups charge that during her Senate term, Heitkamp was too deferential to agribusiness interests. Raimondo clashed early in her tenure with public employee unions in Rhode Island. Emanuel, with his brusque style, clashed with almost every Democratic interest group at some point during his time in the White House and as Chicago mayor. His deepest rift with the left came over charges -- which he has always denied -- that as mayor he permitted the withholding of dashboard camera evidence in the police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. Liberal critics have targeted Reed over his work on key bipartisan agreements during the Clinton administration -- particularly the crime and welfare bills -- and his later position as executive director of the bipartisan "Simpson-Bowles" commission, which in 2010 recommended a mix of cuts to federal entitlement programs, including Social Security, and tax hikes to close the federal budget deficit.In many ways, these arguments merely extend familiar ideological disputes from the Clinton and Obama administrations. Many liberals thought that Clinton, with his promise of finding a "third way," conceded too much to conservative arguments, even before Republicans seized control of both congressional chambers in 1994. If anything, liberal disappointment with Obama may have been more intense because their expectations for him had been so much higher: after generally running to Hillary Clinton's left during their epic 2008 primary battle, he surrounded himself with many centrist appointees, including Emanuel and an economic team (from Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner to White House economic adviser Larry Summers) with close ties to Wall Street. "When it comes to who we are opposing [now] there is a lot of trauma that progressives have from 2008 and 2009," says Waleed Shahid, communications director for Justice Democrats. But the arguments over potential centrist appointments such as Emanuel, Reed or Heitkamp don't only look back toward positions they took in the past. They also encompass a much more immediate dispute over how Biden should proceed now.Compromise -- or polarize?In most cases, the potential centrist nominees drawing the most fire from the left have a track record of negotiating agreements that advanced Democratic goals while accepting concessions that attracted substantial support from either Republicans or ordinarily Republican-leaning business interests, or both. Heitkamp helped to negotiate the 2018 farm bill at a time when Republicans controlled both legislative chambers. For all the liberal complaints about Emanuel, he was the principal architect of the deals with key elements of the medical establishment (including the groups representing doctors, insurers and drug companies) that allowed Obama to succeed where Clinton, Richard Nixon and Harry Truman all failed -- and pass legislation that vastly expanded access to health care, the Affordable Care Act. The left has now branded the bipartisan deals Clinton reached in the 1990s as serial capitulations to Republicans. But while incorporating ideas important to conservatives, each of those agreements also advanced substantial liberal goals: the 1994 crime bill (negotiated primarily by Reed, Emanuel and Biden's incoming White House chief of staff, Ron Klain) banned assault weapons, devoted billions of dollars to new prevention programs and grants meant to encourage communities to adopt community policing, and included the landmark Violence Against Women Act.The welfare overhaul bill provided unprecedented new resources for job training and child care, and the balanced budget deal Clinton reached in 1997 expanded tax credits for families with children and created the widely praised Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides health insurance to children in working-poor families. Reed played a central role in all those negotiations.Embedded in these personnel fights is the strategic question of whether such Clinton- and Obama-style agreements provide a good template for Biden, who centered his campaign on a promise to unify the country and restore bipartisan cooperation in Washington. Given the narrow partisan balance of power that he will inherit, most centrist Democrats believe he needs appointees with the proven capacity to work with Republicans and other groups outside the Democratic coalition.Kessler, of the centrist group Third Way, says that whether or not Democrats win Senate control in the two Georgia runoffs next month, the compromise Covid-19 relief bill recently proposed by a small group of senators from each party previews the kind of legislation most likely to become law through Biden's first two years. "Welcome to the future," Kessler says of the bipartisan Covid proposal. "This is what the next two years is going to look like, and if we're fortunate there are going to be lots of these." If Biden is indeed hoping to replicate such agreements, Emanuel in the Cabinet and/or Reed in a top White House policy post could be important assets to do so. But the liberal groups agitating against Biden's potential centrist nominees believe he's doomed to failure if he tries to advance his priorities by peeling away a handful of Republican legislators, as Obama tried to do on his stimulus (which ultimately won just three Senate Republican votes after substantial concessions) and health care plans (which no Republicans supported)."I think that view of politics is just impractical," says Shahid. "In 2009, you couldn't get a single Republican to vote for the ACA, and in 2021, Congress is even more polarized than it was in 2009. I am afraid of Joe Biden and the people around him pursuing a political strategy developed in the 1980s and 1990s that doesn't fit the nature of our polarized Congress today." To activists on the left, a strategy built on seeking agreements with Senate Republicans ensures months of delay that ultimately end in failure and flagging momentum. Rather than negotiating at length with McConnell and other Senate Republicans, these groups want Biden to stick to his ambitious campaign proposals on issues such as health care and climate and build public pressure on Congress to endorse them. "The only question is whether Democrats spend the next two years playing into Republicans' hands by feeding the pretense that McConnell is seeking to negotiate in good faith," the Justice Democrats, Sunrise Movement and two other left-leaning groups wrote in an open strategy memo to Democrats late last month. "Instead of letting McConnell play his game, Democrats must run against him from day one. This aggressive approach reflects the political realities of our time."Mixed signals so farBiden has offered somewhat mixed signals on his strategy toward congressional Republicans. At times, he's acknowledged that compromise may be more difficult than it was during his Senate career -- a likelihood underscored by the refusal of almost all congressional Republicans even to acknowledge that he won the election. But more often, he's stressed his commitment to rebuilding bridges to the GOP and highlighted (sometimes exaggerating) cases where he did reach agreements with McConnell for Obama. Those around Biden seem certain that he'll start his presidency offering an open hand to McConnell, rather than the updated version of Truman's 1948 attacks on the "do-nothing Congress" that some on the left are urging. "You can't run Harry Truman's strategy from day one of your presidency for four years and think that's going to change things," said one Biden adviser who asked for anonymity to discuss internal discussions.For all the agitation against potential nominees, so far Biden's actual appointments have successfully bridged the party's tightrope; his team to date hasn't provoked a serious backlash from either the center or the left. "Thirty thousand foot zoom out, things feel extremely different now than they did even at the start of the Obama administration," says Green. Both ideological factions feel comfortable with Klain, who has built relationships across the party, as chief of staff. And Biden has found several high-profile selections (such as Janet Yellen at the Treasury Department and Xavier Becerra at Health and Human Services) broadly acceptable to both groups. Yet this consensus will be tested very quickly once Biden takes office and faces the daunting task of winning congressional approval for his agenda -- starting with an ambitious Covid relief package that Senate Republicans have blocked for months. Biden's personnel choices have satisfied such a broad range of Democrats partly because they haven't tipped his hand on how he will approach that puzzle. The real test will begin soon after the inauguration, when Biden's actions reveal more about whether he'll center his dealings with Republicans on conciliation or confrontation.(CNN) - The Trump administration is working to rally support in the Senate for its controversial high-dollar arms sale to the United Arab Emirates ahead of a vote to block that transfer.President Donald Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, participated in a Senate Republican call Tuesday about the planned $23 billion sale of F-35 fighter jets, Reaper drones and munitions to the UAE, according to a Senate aide. Senators of both parties have voiced various concerns about the sale -- including the speed at which it is being pursued and its potential impact on human rights and broader regional security -- and whether Congress was properly involved in the process. CNN has previously reported on Kushner's secret push to sell the weapons to the UAE, causing confusion and frustration among agencies and congressional committees that would normally be involved in such a sale but have been left in the dark. The President's son-in-law also was a key figure in the Abraham Accords, the agreement to normalize relations between the UAE and Israel that paved the way for the proposed sale. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, announced on Twitter last week that he, Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky had introduced a privileged resolution to block the sale. That resolution is expected to be voted on this week. It is unclear if there is enough support for it to pass, but a Democratic aide told CNN that "the fact that the White House is doing such a full-court press suggests they are nervous about vote count."Even if the measure were to garner enough support in Congress, it would likely face a veto from Trump. The President vetoed several bipartisan measures passed by both chambers of Congress to curtail arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE in July 2019.Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs R. Clarke Cooper said in a call with reporters Tuesday that ahead of the end of the 30-day congressional notification period on Friday, the State Department was continuing "to work with the UAE on the letters of offer and acceptance that, if concluded, would finalize any deal.""We continue to engage in a healthy and productive dialogue with Congress on the process as it continues forward," he said. Cooper told reporters that "the diligence and then the expedience of these sales was in the wake of the Abraham Accords" and claimed that the Persian Gulf nation's recognition of Israel had "brought to bear further risk" to the region by Iran. A senior State Department official told CNN that State Department officials have had a slew of calls with Congress about the arms sale and the main issues of concern were the security of the technology transfer and the impact on Israel's qualitative military edge -- the comparative technological, tactical and other advantages in its weapons that allow it to maintain military superiority in the region.Israeli government officials have indicated they do not oppose the sale to the UAE, but concerns over the technology transfer -- and how to prevent that sensitive tech from falling into the hands of adversaries -- remain."You cannot fast-track those sales until you have assurances that the technology transfer is safe, and we cannot tell members of Congress that we have all the assurances we need," the senior State Department official said.CNN has previously reported that arms sold by the US to the Saudis and Emiratis had been transferred to al Qaeda-linked fighters, hardline Salafi militias and other factions waging war in Yemen. The Trump administration cleared the UAE of wrongdoing.New York  (CNN Business) - A version of this article first appeared in the "Reliable Sources" newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.I have been covering the cable news wars since 2004, and this is the most dramatic period I have witnessed. So much is up in the air right now. Here's why: -- We're at an inflection point: The end of the Trump years means an end to the biggest story of the 2010s. The beginning of the Biden years may scramble cable news in ways that remain to be seen. -- Audience patterns are changing: Fox News is facing serious competition from the right for the first time. And CNN is notching win after win in the overall ratings. -- New leaders are taking charge: MSNBC is about to undergo a transition from Phil Griffin, the channel's president for the past twelve years, to Rashida Jones. -- Streaming pressures are paramount: Live news is bolstering the cable bundle, but for how much longer? Every TV news operation is under pressure to have a streaming video strategy. The Information wrote last week about WarnerMedia's potential "subscription offering based on content from CNN" that "could launch next year."Add it all up, and this is an incredibly dynamic time for the industry.CNN's post-election streakThe Fox News winning streak has been snapped. As a series of new promos points out, CNN has been "the most watched cable network" since the day after the election. In the pivotal 25- to 54-year-old demographic, CNN has been No. 1 in cable news for 33 straight days, according to Nielsen data through December 6.This ratings reset has been driven by interest in the election and the transition. It is partly due to CNN's strengths in news-gathering, something Fox has never been able to match. (Don't take my word for it -- just look up CNN's bureaus across the US and around the world, compared to Fox's meager bureau structure.)The reset is also due to Fox's weakness, especially during the day, when some conservative viewers clearly don't want to watch news. Numerous Fox sources have acknowledged that the daytime ratings drop-offs are a serious concern. Some Trump loyalists, disappointed by the election outcome, have flipped over to Newsmax or One America News; others are probably avoiding the news altogether and watching channels like Hallmark or HGTV instead.To some degree this ratings phenomenon was predictable in the event of a Trump loss. Fox's declines may be temporary, just a "blip," so to speak.What's harder to predict is the long-term impact of Fox's right-wing rivals. Hosts on Newsmax and One America News are acting like the election still isn't over. They're acting like Biden is not president-elect. And this is causing some Fox hosts and commentators to disregard their own network's projection, their own reporting, and indulge crazed conspiracy theories. MSNBC's transition of powerShortly after President-elect Biden's inauguration in January, Griffin will step aside at MSNBC. Jones will become president of the channel on February 1. She will be the first Black person to run a major cable news network.The Wall Street Journal broke the news on Monday, just before Cesar Conde sent out a memo. He said Jones "has an outstanding track-record and she leads with a laser-like focus and grace under pressure. I know she will be an excellent leader for MSNBC."Jones has ample experience with daytime, weekend and special events programming. But MSNBC's highest-rated shows are evening talkers like "The Rachel Maddow Show" and "The Beat with Ari Melber." She will be in charge of keeping those shows humming and trying to spread their ratings mojo to other times of day. It is a big challenge: While November was MSNBC's most-watched month in its 24-year history, owing to the election, the channel still ranked third in cable news behind CNN and Fox News. My impression, as someone who studies the numbers every day, is that MSNBC doesn't benefit as much from breaking news spikes. Audiences are primed to turn on CNN and Fox at those moments, not MSNBC.Question marks -- Will the current ratings trends hold? Or will Fox's audience "come home," as an exec at the network predicted last month? -- Will CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker stay at WarnerMedia? Brian Steinberg's story for Variety says that "Zucker is not believed to have made a final decision yet about whether to remain at CNN's helm or to seek a new role."  -- What other changes will Conde make at NBCUniversal? Conde's memo said that Griffin approached him about stepping aside, but the WSJ story also cited a "person familiar with the discussions" who "said Mr. Conde was already looking to make a change at the network." -- Will the Biden era actually be a ratings "bore," as so many have predicted? When I hear people say that "Trump is good for ratings," my retort is that "news is good for ratings," and Trump generated a metric ton of news and scandal and outrage. -- Will Newsmax gain any more ground? Greg Kelly and other Newsmax hosts have come off their immediate post-election highs. The channel's ratings are still way ahead of Fox Business, though. -- Will Trump strike a deal with a right-wing TV channel and change the competitive landscape? Washington  (CNN) - President-elect Joe Biden on Tuesday will introduce the scientists and doctors he says will finally defeat the pandemic -- but for now, his team can only watch as a wave of infection and death deepens the crisis he will face after January 20.As Biden will give his most significant preview yet of his plan to tackle the worst health challenge in 100 years, President Donald Trump -- whose dereliction of duty has contributed to the alarming winter surge -- will hold his own pandemic event. He will pitch for credit for the swift development of Covid-19 vaccines and sign an executive order prioritizing their supply for Americans.The dueling events -- one in Biden's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and other at the White House -- will showcase the vastly different approaches to the pandemic between Trump and Biden. The President has repeatedly downplayed the disaster as he concentrates instead on false claims that last month's election was stolen from him. Biden, whose own campaign was an exercise in demonstrating social distancing and masking, is pledging to put science back at the center of the fight against the virus.In the meantime, the tragedy of the pandemic is being exacerbated by the political vacuum in Washington. Trump, in his last weeks in office, has the power and presidential megaphone that could go a long way toward convincing Americans to take precautions, but has no inclination to do so. Biden has the plans and a fresh team of experts who could make a difference, but he has no real power to shift American behavior and policies until he is inaugurated next month.The coming vaccines from a handful of pharmaceutical giants offer hope that normal life can be restored next year -- though getting them in the arms of tens of millions of Americans will be a huge logistical challenge. There is no doubting, however, that the crisis is quickly getting worse. One expert, Dr. Peter Hotez of the Baylor College of Medicine, warned Monday on CNN that the US, which is closing in on 15 million Covid-19 infections and a total death toll of 300,000, could soon regularly see 3,000 Covid-19 deaths every day.And America's top infectious disease specialist, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said Monday that after the projected post-Thanksgiving and Christmas surges kick in, the "middle of January could be a really dark time for us."That means the Biden administration will take office at the most extreme moment of the crisis and will face the task of getting up to speed and managing the hugely complicated operation to roll out tens of millions of vaccine doses. Biden's appeal to all Americans in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper to wear masks for the first 100 days of his presidency will likely be even more appropriate given that the current infection levels will likely be dwarfed by the time he reaches the Oval Office.There is also the question of whether millions of Americans who buy Trump's false claims of a rigged election will be willing to take advice from a President who his mask-disdaining predecessor spent weeks baselessly branding as illegitimate.Trump plans 'America First' vaccine summit Trump continues to lie about the pandemic's seriousness, insisting for weeks that the US is "rounding the corner" in the disaster that his negligence exacerbated. He continues to flout the advice on social distancing and avoiding large gatherings from his own government.On Tuesday, he plans to use a vaccine summit to sign an executive order at the White House aimed at prioritizing the shipment of the coronavirus vaccine to Americans over other nations. The administration's Operation Warp Speed deserves some of the credit in the swift development of vaccines. But Tuesday's event also seems to reflect the President's relentless focus on using the crisis to advance his own political priorities since senior administration officials boasted that Trump saw the effort as a way of boosting his "America first" foreign policy principle. It is also probably not a coincidence that the President is seeking to make such a splash following a New York Times report that found his administration had turned down an offer by vaccine maker Pfizer last summer to sell the US more supplies of its vaccine. It has emerged in the last few days that previous predictions by administration officials of several hundred million vaccine doses being available by the end of the year will fall well short, leaving states without sufficient inoculations to protect front-line health care workers when they get their first deliveries.Loyce Pace, a public health expert who serves on Biden's coronavirus advisory board, said she hoped that the other coming vaccines would mean the Pfizer situation would not represent a serious setback."Those of us on the transition advisory board are hopeful that we will not run into an issue with regards to a shortage. But I think we just have to get in and understand where we are with those plans and supplies," Pace told CNN's Erin Burnett.The timing of Trump's event is also suspicious because Tuesday's headlines are expected to be dominated by coverage of the UK becoming the first country to administer vaccines after a rigorous process of clinical trials.Trump had hoped to stage an "America first" victory lap of his own, and CNN reported last week he was furious that Food and Drug Administration officials -- expected to grant emergency authorization to the Pfizer vaccine this week -- had not beaten the British to the punch. He took this attitude even though the FDA process is considered the global gold standard and officials already face a tough task in convincing many skeptical Americans to take the jab.Biden tasks health team with ending the pandemic In Wilmington on Tuesday, the President-elect will unveil a new health team characterized by the kind of scientific rigor that Trump has often disdained during the pandemic. The lineup includes former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, whom Biden plans to nominate for a second spell in the same job, and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, whom the President-elect has picked to head the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fauci has accepted an invitation from Biden to stay on as the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases -- a post he has held since 1984. The globally respected expert will also serve as the Biden administration's chief medical officer.But some Republicans are already raising flags at the selection of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra as Health and Human Services secretary. "I think he will be controversial," said GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, citing the nominee's positions on single-payer health care and abortion. "Some of these folks are pretty radical." The comment raised the possibility that Biden faces a protracted confirmation showdown over his HHS secretary at the darkest moment of the worst public health crisis in 100 years.The profound concern among health experts is all the more acute because there is such good news as more of the potential vaccine candidates that have shown high efficiency come on line.But fatigue over social distancing, the temptation for people to gather during the holiday period and efforts by the President to minimize the seriousness of the threat could cause hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths."I just can't help but think, as Americans lose their lives in the coming weeks, none of those people have to lose their lives," Hotez of Baylor College told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on the "Situation Room.""If we could just get them to the other side to get them vaccinated, they could live a long and normal life, and that's where my priority is right now, especially in the middle part of the country, where people are still defiant of messages ... where many still think Covid is a hoax or deaths are due to other causes."Virus' winter assaultWith leadership missing from the President, the burden of stemming the winter assault from the virus has fallen again to local and state leaders. Many are reintroducing restrictions on indoor dining, on the sizes of gatherings and other measures. California, which is experiencing its worst Covid-19 surge since the start of the pandemic, has imposed a shutdown that will last until after Christmas."People are getting exhausted, they're getting lonely and they just want it to be over," California Lt. Gov Eleni Kounalakis told Christiane Amanpour on CNN International."And so what we're trying to do is really call upon Californians to recognize that this is the most dangerous part of the entire pandemic. But there is a light at the end of the tunnel," she said, referring to vaccines.Seeing its own infections spike, Washington, DC, banned contact sports such as football, basketball and hockey on Monday. Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf said he was considering new restrictions after warning that health care workers were becoming overwhelmed and exhausted as the situation got much more dire.Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo basked in praise from Fauci on Monday for his efforts to keep infections down. But the governor warned that his state may again experience the kinds of restrictions imposed during its terrible Covid-19 spring this year, predicting that authorities would soon have to prohibit indoor dining in New York City."The frustrations we are seeing here -- we estimate that over 70% of the spread is coming from small gatherings," Cuomo said. "I've been talking about it until I am blue in the face about the apparent safety of being home."Such closures will inevitably mean a deterioration in already dire economic conditions, with millions of Americans unemployed because of the pandemic and small businesses folding everywhere.This makes it even more vital that Congress finally overcomes its divisions and produces a new Covid-19 rescue plan that will extend expired unemployment benefits and offer relief for businesses.The best short-term hope for those Americans is an effort to fund the government with an interim bill to buy time for more stimulus talks and a broader spending bill before Christmas.Editor's Note: Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book "OK Boomer, Let's Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind."

Watch Rebekah Jones' home being invaded by Florida cops: They burst in, shouting orders and pointing guns, like it's a military raid. It was a hyper-aggressive and totally unnecessary maneuver for carrying out a search warrant related to an alleged computer crime. Jones is a Florida data scientist who created the state's Covid-19 dashboard of case rates and infection maps. She was fired in May from her job at the state's Department of Health. She says the dismissal was for refusing to manipulate the data to make the Covid risk look lower than it was, and for publicly questioning the transparency and accessibility of the data. The state says it was for "insubordination," for making unauthorized public remarks and "unilateral decisions to modify the Department's COVID-19 dashboard without input or approval from the epidemiological team or her supervisors." Now Jones is under investigation for allegedly accessing a government messaging system after she was fired to send this message, according to an affidavit from an investigator for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, to state employees:  "Speak up before another 17,000 people are dead. You know this is wrong. You don't have to be a part of this. Be a hero. Speak out before it's too late."Jones flatly denies the allegations, saying that she did not have access to the system, and that her comments about Florida's Covid failures were made publicly -- including in an op-ed she wrote for the Miami Herald in July.Jones says the investigation is retaliation by Gov. Ron DeSantis, whom she has accused of politicizing the pandemic and pushing to reopen Florida too soon. DeSantis's office denies any involvement with the investigation. But whatever Jones did or didn't do, the raid on her home was indefensible. Jones's security cam shows the terrifying intrusion;  she can be heard in the background crying out that her children are in the house as the police enter and point their guns up the stairs and shout for her family to come down. Jones says the officers pointed their guns at her children, which the police deny. In a statement, police said Jones took 23 minutes to open the door after their repeated attempts to contact her, including by knocking and phoning. "Agents exercised tremendous restraint throughout the execution of the search warrant yesterday, especially considering the significant delay they faced in gaining entry and what that could represent to officer safety," the statement said.Again, I would refer you to the startling video and to the computer issue that drew authorities to investigate Jones. How in any rational scenario can police justify such a guns-drawn, hyper-aggressive entry to make a simple search in the home of a woman they have no reason to believe will react with violence? After the killing of Breonna Taylor, fatally shot in her own bed at night when police burst through her front door, more attention has been focused on the dangerous and often deadly use of no-knock warrants. But it's not just those extreme cases that are troubling.American police are armed to the hilt. This is partly because our exceptionally lax gun laws mean there are an absurd number of armed people walking the streets, and partly because American policing has too often become a hyper-macho militaristic enterprise wherein some cops aren't so much serving their communities as using the threat of force (and billions of dollars of military equipment straight from the Department of Defense) to dominate them. In more than a dozen countries, including the United Kingdom, the police typically don't carry guns. There's little chance of that happening in the gun-happy United States anytime soon. But we should ask why the police need to send a heavily armed team, guns drawn, to execute a search warrant in the home of a person suspected of a nonviolent crime. Why risk escalating a simple search into something terrifying and potentially lethal?These officers likely did nothing technically wrong; it very well may be department policy to carry out simple raids with this appalling level of aggression and intimidation. And as a White woman, Jones is statistically far less likely to be killed or injured by a cop than, say, a young black man, one in 1,000 of whom can expect to be killed by a police officer.  We should be asking why the police, whose salaries are paid with our tax dollars and who are tasked with protecting and serving our communities, behave with such hostility toward the people who are being policed -- instead of treating them with dignity -- and rely so heavily on lethal weapons to induce terror to get what they want. (CNN) - A federal court has dismissed a 47-count indictment against the captain and two managers charged in connection with the fatal duck boat sinking in Missouri in July 2018.A judge recommended in September that the charges be dismissed for "lack of admiralty jurisdiction," commonly known as the Seaman's manslaughter statute. Judge David P. Rush noted in his reasoning for the dismissal that Table Rock Lake, where the incident occurred, is not considered navigable as a matter of admiralty law.The judge also recommended the case should be prosecuted at the state level rather than in a federal court should it continue.The charges stemmed from the fatal sinking of a duck boat -- an amphibious vehicle that travels on land and water -- at a lake near Branson, a popular family vacation spot. Seventeen people died after the boat capsized during a severe thunderstorm.An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that Ride the Ducks Branson, the tour operator, and its parent company, Ripley Entertainment, were to blame for the incident because managers did not relay a severe weather forecast to the vessel's captain.Scott McKee, the boat's captain; Curtis Lanham, the general manager of Ride the Ducks Branson; and Charles Baltzell, the manager on duty that day, had been charged in the indictment.Tia Coleman, an Indianapolis mother who lost her husband and three young children in the sinking, released a statement Tuesday through her representative saying she will continue to pursue justice.She urged the Missouri State Attorney General to pursue criminal charges so "those criminally responsible for 17 preventable deaths can finally be held accountable by a jury," according to the statement.(CNN) - President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Tuesday aimed at prioritizing the shipment of the coronavirus vaccine to Americans before other nations, according to senior administration officials.  The signing is slated to take place during a vaccine summit at the White House, with the hope that the order will allay fears that there will not be enough doses of the vaccine to go around after distribution begins.White House officials described the order as a "reaffirmation of the President's commitment to America first." But on a call with reporters Monday evening, in which administration officials asked not to be identified publicly, the White House did not provide specifics on how the order will do that.  The order comes after The New York Times reported Monday that Pfizer had offered to sell the US government additional doses in late summer, but the newspaper said the administration had turned it down. The decision to not purchase more doses mounted administration concerns that Pfizer would be unable to fulfill any additional US order until June because of the company's commitments to other countries. On the Monday evening call, Trump administration officials denied they had turned down an opportunity to buy more doses of the Pfizer vaccine months ago. One senior administration official said the administration is "in the middle of a negotiation right now" and can't speak publicly about the Pfizer talks. "But we feel absolutely confident" that there will be a "sufficient number of doses to vaccinate all Americans who desire one before the end of the second quarter of 2021," the official said.The initial US contract, an advance purchase agreement with Pfizer, was signed on July 22, the administration official said. That agreement was for 100 million doses with the option to purchase more. The 100 million doses would be enough to vaccinate 50 million people, because it's a two-dose vaccine.The administration official said on Monday's call that they are continuing to negotiate with several companies working on Covid-19 vaccines. The US has the opportunity to purchase 3 billion doses of vaccine, among all the contracts the federal government currently has with various companies. That would in theory be enough to vaccinate the US population several times over.Pfizer would not disclose whether a deal for additional doses for the US had fallen through or if any additional orders would be unable to be fulfilled until the summer. "(The) U.S. government placed an initial order of 100 million doses for Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine and Pfizer is ready to begin shipping initial doses soon after receiving an Emergency Use Authorization from FDA," the company said in a statement. "Any additional doses beyond the 100 million are subject to a separate and mutually-acceptable agreement. The company is not able to comment on any confidential discussions that may be taking place with the U.S. government."Administration officials on Monday evening's call also confirmed that representatives for Pfizer and Moderna will not attend Tuesday's White House summit, despite being the companies behind the coronavirus vaccines seeking emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration. White House officials said representatives for the companies won't be there "because the administration felt it was more important for regulators to attend and explain the authorization process to the American people. "Both companies were involved with "initial discussions" of the planning of the summit, but "there was a change of direction in light of the fact we would have the regulator participating in the event," an official said. "It was more appropriate not to add one or more vaccine companies with pending applications before the FDA," the official said.Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA official in charge of which Covid-19 vaccines get authorized, will attend to "explain to the audience how the FDA goes about reviewing vaccines, and how thorough they are -- just why the FDA review process is the gold standard for the world," an official described on the call. An official billed the summit as an effort to educate Americans about the vaccine approval process, assure that the vaccine is safe and to "congratulate the members of Operation Warp Speed."Also absent from the list of participants is Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. An official said Fauci was invited and wanted to participate but wasn't able to because of an "important scheduling issue."(CNN) - Program notes: Chef José Andrés joins hosts Anderson Cooper and Kelly Ripa this Sunday at 8 pm ET / PT for CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute. You can donate to World Central Kitchen right now at CNNHeroes.com.Chef José Andrés, who has spent much of 2020 feeding people on the frontlines of the Covid-19 pandemic, called the United States government's inability to prevent millions of Americans from going hungry a "natural disaster.""This is a natural disaster," Andrés said when asked by CNN's Anderson Cooper why the government isn't doing more to help with food insecurity in the US. "I think the federal government has been missing in action with many announcements of things that they look good on paper, but that then, when you go on the ground, you see that things are not working," he said. "One way to feed the hungry is making sure that we make the political will. We need to redefine what it means to take care of Americans." The interview was part of the "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute." Andrés is currently on the Colombian island of San Andrés working with his non-profit, World Central Kitchen, to feed survivors of Hurricane Iota, the final named storm of the 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season -- and also the year's strongest.Over the past few years, the award-winning chef has responded to several major crises. After an earthquake devastated Haiti, Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico, wildfires scorched Southern California, and a refugee crisis intensified on the Venezuelan border, he quickly mobilized volunteer chefs in each of those spots to prepare meals for thousands of people in need.Now, during the global coronavirus pandemic, Andrés has been leading the charge to provide food relief to the elderly, those suddenly without work and frontline health care and essential workers.'We must do better'The Covid-19 crisis posed a monumental challenge for World Central Kitchen, Andrés said. He recounted the early days of the pandemic, when the organization helped feed the  passengers and crew quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship that docked in Yokohoma, Japan. Nearly half of the people on board eventually tested positive for the virus."Before we knew, the same thing was happening in Oakland, California," he said. In April, the organization assembled another chef relief team to feed passengers and crew quarantined aboard a cruise ship in Oakland.As the pandemic spread, Andrés ramped up food relief efforts to also help the many families now struggling to put food on the table. He said World Central Kitchen found a flood of people arriving in food lines for the first time in their lives. "They are having a hard time, because they lost their job, because they, for different reasons, they are not able to get unemployment, or they never got the unemployment," he said. "This, to a degree, is wrong, (this) shouldn't be the American way. We can do better. We must do better."'The smart way to do it'Andrés points fingers at both Democrats and Republicans for the political gridlock forcing too many American's to depend on NGOs and soup kitchens. "It's actually Mitch McConnell's Kentucky, where 13% of the people say they don't have enough to eat, as well as Nancy Pelosi's California, where it's 11%," he said. "This is a problem that shouldn't be happening. Congress, the Senate, the White House -- they must put into place all the resources we have.""Every dollar you spend to feed somebody, you are putting the economy back at work," he added. "This is the smart way to do it."  During the interview, Andrés also took a moment to recognize the unsung heroes who inspire him.He mentioned Fatima Castillo, a Guatemalan volunteer whose local knowledge helped World Central Kitchen feed her community following the eruption of Volcano Fuego in 2018. He also applauded Marcus Samuelsson, a celebrity chef whose work feeding those in need is not as well-known as his restaurants. The chef also credited the young people he has seen stepping up around the world. "It makes me feel good -- because I see young people ready to jump in, not caring about who you are, your religion, the color of your skin, what's the accent you have speaking English," he said. "They (have) one goal in mind: to make sure that they can provide aid and relief and hope with a smile."(CNN) - No one does the holidays quite like the Kardashian-Jenner clan, but things are different this year, according to Khloe Kardashian.The reality star, who confirmed not long ago that she had contracted and recovered from Covid-19, posted on Twitter that her famous family is canceling their annual Christmas Eve party because of the pandemic.After a Twitter follower asked Kardashian about the party, she tweeted, "The Covid cases are getting out of control in CA.""So we decided that we're not doing a Christmas Eve party this year. It's the first time we will not be having a Christmas Eve party since 1978 I believe," Kardashian wrote. "Health and safety first though! Taking this pandemic seriously is a must."Rising numbers of Covid-19 cases in California has led to prompted modified stay-at-home orders for the San Joaquin Valley and Southern California, where most of the Kardashian-Jenner family have homes. Responding to another follower, Kardashian wrote, "Truly we are all so upset about it.""I don't know if you guys are making fun of me right now LOL but I really I'm talking about the Christmas Eve party LOL," she wrote.The family also will not be doing their annual Christmas card that fans look forward to every year."We have not done anything," Kardashian tweeted. "No Christmas photos and no Christmas Eve party this year. Covid has taken over." Viewers of their hit E! reality series "Keeping Up With the Kardashians" know that the card didn't happen yesterday either because of family drama over the theme and scheduling. The cancellation of the party comes weeks after her sisters Kim Kardashian West and Kendall Jenner were criticized after both held well-attended parties during the pandemic.Kardashian West threw a birthday party for herself on a private island with her friends and family in October and Jenner held a star-studded 25th birthday Halloween party. (CNN) - Police chiefs across the country are hoping President-elect Joe Biden's incoming administration will help them address a crisis of legitimacy and focus on reform measures after a string of high-profile shootings by police officers and subsequent protests roiled the nation this summer. A survey of almost 400 police chiefs, administered by the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), asked law enforcement leaders across the country to identify priorities for the incoming administration. The top two results: Increasing public trust and addressing the call for reform.Biden identified police reform as a priority of his racial equity agenda following a summer of unrest in cities across the country. The protests were prompted by the death of George Floyd in May, who died after a now-fired member of the Minneapolis Police Department knelt on his neck during an arrest.It's not clear what Biden will be able to accomplish, and the makeup of the US Senate is contingent on special election results in Georgia. Biden's transition team met with the Fraternal Order of Police in November, and has met with other groups representing law enforcement since.The chiefs, surveyed at the end of November, were asked to identify three policing issues in greatest need of addressing. A clear majority said they hope the Biden administration will help increase trust in police, with 76% calling it a priority, and 57% wanting to address calls for police reform. Fewer than half of respondents -- 43% -- said crime reduction was among their top three priorities for next year.'We have to rebuild trust'A separate question on the survey asked chiefs how they'd counsel the president given the chance at a private meeting on his first day and many of their answers spoke to the idea of "rebuilding trust."
