(CNN) - Australia will jointly develop hypersonic cruise missiles with the United States in a bid to counter China and Russia which are developing similar weapons, Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said on Tuesday."We will continue to invest in advanced capabilities to give the Australian Defence Force more options to deter aggression against Australia's interests," Reynolds said in a statement.She did not reveal the cost of developing the missiles or when they would be operational.Australia had set aside up to 9.3 billion Australian dollars ($6.8 billion) this year for high-speed, long-range missile defense systems, including hypersonic research.Hypersonic missiles are capable of traveling at more than five times the speed of sound and the combination of speed, maneuverability and altitude makes them difficult to track and intercept.Last year Russia deployed its first hypersonic nuclear-capable missiles, while the Pentagon, which tested a similar hypersonic missile in 2017, has a goal of fielding hypersonic war-fighting capabilities in the early to mid-2020s.China has deployed, or is close to deploying, hypersonic systems armed with conventional warheads, according to defense analysts.Australia said in July it would boost defense spending by 40% over the next 10 years to acquire longer-range strike capabilities across air, sea and land. The move comes as Canberra broadens its military focus from the Pacific to the Indo-Pacific region.Australia's collaboration with the United States on missile development, however, could inflame tensions with China.Relations between Australia and its largest trading partner hit a new low on Monday after a senior Chinese official posted a fake image of an Australian soldier holding a knife to the throat of an Afghan child.(CNN) - As millions of people in the United States travel back home from the Thanksgiving holiday, daily Covid-19 hospitalizations are inching closer to 100,000 -- the highest they've ever been. Now health experts are asking those who gathered with people outside their households to get tested."If your family traveled, you have to assume that you were exposed and you became infected," White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx told CBS on Sunday. She also recommended those older than 65 get tested immediately if they develop any symptoms."If you're over 65 or you have comorbidities and you gathered at Thanksgiving -- if you develop any symptoms, you need to be tested immediately," Birx said.More people passed through airport security on Sunday than on any other single day since the coronavirus pandemic cratered air travel, according to the Transportation Security Administration.  TSA screened 1.17 million people on Sunday, when many Americans were heading home from their Thanksgiving travels, it said. That means more than 9.4 million people were screened in the Thanksgiving travel window, which began the Friday before the holiday.   November has been a month of unprecedented coronavirus surge, with 27 consecutive days of new cases surpassing 100,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. And as hospitalizations reached a new record of 93,238 on Sunday, it was the third time the metric surpassed 90,000 this month, according to the Covid Tracking Project. "There's no way that the hospitals can be fully prepared for what we're currently facing," emergency medicine physician Dr. Megan Ranney said."This is like a natural disaster occurring in all 50 states at the same time. There are not adequate beds. There are not adequate staff. And because of the lack of national preparation, there are still not adequate supplies." Statistics reported in the days after the holiday might show a relative dip in Covid-19 cases, followed by a surge due to a lag in government agencies' reporting over the long weekend.And given coronavirus' lengthy incubation time and how long it takes an infected person to test positive, cases related to Thanksgiving are unlikely to show in public data until the first full week of December at the earliest.US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams told "Fox News Sunday" he expects new infections and hospitalizations to get worse over the coming weeks. "Make sure you're washing your hands and make sure again if you've been in a gathering of more than 10 people without your mask on over the last several days, please get tested in the next three to five days," he said. Spread is worst in the Midwest, expert saysAs the US wrestles with managing the cases until a vaccine can be distributed, states are faring differently.If Arizona officials don't address the rise in cases in the next two to three weeks, the state will be facing a humanitarian crisis leading to hundreds of preventable deaths, the University of Arizona's Zuckerman College of Public Health said in a report Friday."While targeted measures might have sufficiently slowed transmission weeks ago, I believe shelter-in-place orders offer the most certain chance to achieve the improvements needed," the report's main author, Dr. Joe Gerald, also an assistant professor, said Saturday. In New York City, once the epicenter of the virus' spread in the US, the state will send students up to fifth grade back to public schools for in-person learning in early December, Mayor Bill de Blasio said. Students will be tested weekly and parents will be required to sign a consent form for every student that will take in-person classes, de Blasio said.Even so, New York is experiencing a positivity rate of 4.27%, the highest rate since May, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday.Rates of spread are worse in the Midwest than in other parts of the country, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration said Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation." "If you see what's happening in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, where governors took more aggressive steps early, where there's more consistent use of masks, where they took less infection going into this season -- I think you're going to see infection remain rates remain lower than we're seeing in other parts of the country like the Midwest," Gottlieb said.Ohio's statewide total surpassed 400,000 cases on Saturday, with more than 100,000 added in less than two weeks, according to the state's Covid-19 dashboard.Some Americans could get vaccines in DecemberVaccine candidates from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech have shown promising rates of efficacy in testing. Moderna intends to apply Monday to the FDA for authorization of its Covid-19 vaccine. It will ask the agency to review an expanded data set showing the vaccine is 94.1% effective at preventing Covid-19 and 100% effective at preventing severe cases of the disease.  "This is striking," said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory committee. "These are amazing data."  Pfizer and BioNTech on November 20 asked the FDA for emergency use authorization for their coronavirus vaccine candidate, the first to seek regulatory clearance in the US.An expected 40 million vaccine doses will be ready by the end of the year, but that is not enough for everyone who needs it to get one, Adams told Fox.Advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have called an emergency meeting for Tuesday to vote on who they recommend should be the first to get a coronavirus vaccine once one is authorized."The vaccine advisory committee that advises CDC will make recommendations on who should get the vaccine first, the so-called 1A group -- the people who should get it immediately, when it becomes available," Gottlieb told CBS.Gottlieb said he expects health care workers, long-term care residents and staff to be the first group of people eligible for the vaccine. "That's pretty much decided -- they're going to vote on it this week," he said. "I'd be very surprised if they deviate from that."The first release of vaccines will likely coincide with when cases related to Thanksgiving gatherings will begin to show. Although the CDC recommended that Americans not travel for Thanksgiving, more than 6 million people passed through security at US airports leading up to the holiday."When you look at people who are hospitalized today, they were infected two weeks ago, maybe more," said Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a professor of medicine at George Washington University. "And then it takes usually another week for folks to succumb to the illness."(CNN) - Small reptiles like lizards and geckos are known for their extraordinary ability to regrow their tails, a potentially lifesaving skill in the wild. But it turns out these reptiles are not the only animals in the amniote family with the ability to regenerate appendages. Researchers were surprised to discover that juvenile alligators also have the ability to regrow their tails up to 9 inches, or up to 18% of their total body length, according to a new study in Scientific Reports. A team of scientists from Arizona State University and the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries used advanced imaging techniques together with time-tested methods of studying anatomy and tissue organization to find that the alligators' regrown tails had a central cartilage skeleton without any bone, exhibiting features of both regeneration and wound repair. "The regrown skeleton was surrounded by connective tissue and skin but lacked any skeletal muscle (which lizard tails do regenerate with)," Kenro Kusumi, co-senior study author and professor and director of ASU's School of Life Sciences and associate dean in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, told CNN. Even a muscle-less regrown tail is vital for the massive predators, Kusumi added. The team of researchers says that understanding these limitations may help in developing regenerative therapies in humans."We know that humans -- who are incapable of regenerating -- have the same cells and pathways being used to regenerate in these other animals," Jeanne Wilson-Rawls, co-senior study author and associate professor with ASU's School of Life Sciences, told CNN. "If this very large long-limbed animal has this ability, can we take advantage of this to help people who have lost limbs or burn victims who need skin regeneration?"Kusumi quickly added that this isn't something that is going to happen tomorrow, but maybe by the end of the century.(CNN) - More than 940,000 mail-in ballots have been requested in Georgia for the January 5 runoff election that will decide which party controls the Senate, Gabriel Sterling, the state's voting systems implementation manager, said Monday.That includes 604,255 people who are eligible to receive mail-in ballots automatically, according to Sterling. For comparison, 1,322,529 absentee ballots were cast in November's general election, according to a release from the Georgia Secretary of State's office.Sterling said that 1,040 ballots have been returned so far, a "small trickle that we except to get larger soon."Georgia voters are required to request absentee ballots again for the runoff, even if they voted absentee in November, except those over the age of 65, members of the military or physically disabled people who requested absentee ballots for the entire election cycle. Republicans are struggling to encourage voters to back incumbent Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue as President Donald Trump continues to cast doubt on the results of the presidential election. If either of the incumbent Republicans hold onto their seats, the party will retain its majority control in the chamber. If Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock both prevail, however, Democrats would gain control of the Senate thanks to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote.On Saturday, Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel attempted to persuade Republicans to vote in the elections, even as some voters expressed ambivalence about expanding resources in a contest they see as already decided. Trump is slated to travel to the Peach State on Saturday to campaign for Loeffler and Perdue.On Monday, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger -- both Republicans -- rebuffed Trump's calls to overturn the state's election results more than a week after they certified Joe Biden as the winner.For weeks, Trump has made a series of unfounded claims of fraud in the state, for which there is no evidence. Biden won the state by more than 12,000 votes, and both Kemp and Raffensperger have pledged they will abide by the law."Well, I told (Sens. Loeffler and Perdue) today, I think you're dealing in a very fraudulent system. I'm very worried about that," the President said during a news conference Thursday, calling both Republican senators "tremendous people."Loeffler and Perdue have called for Raffensperger to resign, claiming wrongdoing but without providing any specific evidence to back up their claims.The ongoing coronavirus pandemic also continues to loom over the logistics of the upcoming runoff election. Georgia has faced 471,563 coronavirus cases -- the sixth-most cases of any state -- as well as 9,452 deaths from the virus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.The election process has been underway since earlier this month, with November 18 as the earliest date for a registrar to mail an absentee ballot. December 7 marks the voter registration deadline to vote in the federal runoff election, and advanced in-person or early voting begins for the general election runoff for federal offices on December 14.New York  (CNN) - New York schools will begin phasing out hybrid learning and move toward resuming in-person classes after citywide shutdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday.The country's largest public school district will begin reopening in phases for in-person learning on December 7, de Blasio said in a news conference. The city closed public school buildings on November 19 after the city's seven-day average reached a 3% positive testing rate, the threshold set by the mayor for closing schools. All students transitioned to remote learning.Schools will no longer be required to close when the city reaches the 3% test-positivity rate, De Blasio said Sunday.Students will be randomly tested every week and parents will be required to sign a consent form for every student that will take in-person classes, he added. "It's less concern about the spread when it comes to younger kids," de Blasio said. "Also the demands that our parents are going through. I feel for all our parents who are experiencing so many challenges right now, how important it is for them to have their younger kids in school, how important it is at that age both educationally, socially, but also in terms of how parents juggle all the challenges in their life."New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a press call Sunday that safely opening schools during the pandemic is "the right direction and the right decision."Students in 3K, Pre-K and grades K-5 can resume in-person classes on December 7, said de Blasio. The city will address when middle and high schoolers can return to in-person classes in the future.There's a "little bit of extra work to do," de Blasio said, to get District 75 schools and special education programs running. All grades in District 75 schools, which provide specialized instruction for students with significant needs, will reopen to in-person learning beginning December 10."Getting our kids back in school buildings is one of the single most important things we can do for their wellbeing, and it's so important that we do it right," Schools Chancellor Richard A. Carranza said in a statement."The unparalleled value of in-person learning for students has been evident in the first few months of school, and we will do everything we can to keep our schools safe and keep them open for the duration of this pandemic."Nearly 330,000 students are eligible to return to school. The goal is to get as many schools as possible on a regular five-day, in-person class schedule, de Blasio said.Editor's Note: Steven A.

Pisar's father had been killed by the Gestapo and his mother and sister died in Auschwitz.  Samuel, a teenager, escaped from a "death march," Blinken said, where German troops, retreating from the advancing Allied forces, made starving inmates, mainly Jews, walk miles from Poland to camps in Austria and other places inside Germany. Those who could not keep up were shot by SS guards. Those who did not die on the journey generally were killed when they reached their new camps. After hiding out in the Bavarian woods, Pisar heard the rumbling of a tank. When he peeked out to see who it was, he was shocked and elated. "Instead of an Iron Cross, he saw a five-pointed White Star," Blinken said. "He ran to the tank. The hatch opened. An African American GI looked down at him. He got down on his knees and said the only three words he knew in English that his mother had taught him: 'God Bless America.'" Blinken's half-sister Leah Pisar wrote in an op-ed for The Hill in 2018 that the family would later learn the soldier's name: Sgt. Bill Ellington, who served in the 761st Tank Battalion. It is, perhaps, one of the great ironies of history that a resourceful Jewish boy fleeing for his life in Poland was carried to freedom by a Black man fighting in a racially segregated army for a country that accorded the soldier little freedom at home. The story of the 761st, a Black fighting force --- and one of the very few at the time -- is one of perseverance, skill and bravery in the face of doubt and racism. The 761st was among the most storied Black units of World War II. It overcame harassment and violence by white GIs and civilians at their training camps in the South and had to deal with the skepticism of military brass who didn't believe Black people could master sophisticated tank doctrine -- or, for that matter, serve in any combat roles.Still, the 761st spearheaded Gen. George Patton's thrust across the strongly defended Siegfried Line and into Germany; fought at the Battle of the Bulge and was one of the first American units to link up with Soviet forces advancing from the east.  Its 676 enlisted men and 36 officers won 11 Silver Stars, 69 Bronze Stars and about 300 Purple Hearts. Years after the war, President Jimmy Carter awarded the battalion a Presidential Unit Citation for Extraordinary Heroism. One of the battalion's soldiers, Sgt. Ruben Rivers became one of the first African Americans to win the Medal of Honor for bravery during World War II. Yet, unlike the famed Tuskegee Airmen, the tankers and their exploits are not widely known. A few books have been written about them, including one, "Brothers in Arms," by basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Anthony Walton. But none have been bestsellers. And a 1991 public television documentary, "The Liberators," was enmeshed in controversy and recalled after a five-month review of the film produced no evidence of its claims that the 761st liberated Dachau and Buchenwald. (The documentary filmmakers said they stood by their work.)   Even the unit's nickname "The Black Panthers," has been overshadowed. It is less associated with their valiant example of the African American contribution to the Greatest Generation than with a militant Black political party and a comic book superhero.  The 761st, like other Black units, was formed after former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, responding to entreaties by civil rights activists, lobbied her husband and military leaders to integrate the armed services. But FDR, not wanting to anger the white Southern Democrats in his coalition, went along with the brass's view that African Americans could serve only in support roles such as maintenance, transportation and supply-- meant for show, not combat. Some Whites referred to the 761st as "Eleanor Roosevelt's niggers". Sent to Camp Claiborne in Louisiana, the men of the 761st were targets of the typical subjugation and humiliation of the Jim Crow South, especially by the White military-police officers and residents of the nearby town of Alexandria. One day in March 1943, the men had had enough. Responding to the severe beating of two of their comrades in town, and a report that another Black soldier had been killed by racist Whites, a number of the soldiers hopped in their tanks and were heading to town with the intention of shooting up the place.They were stopped at the gate of the camp by their White commanding officer, Lt. Col. Paul Bates who promised he would look into the situation. "If anything like this ever happens again, I swear I'll lead you into town myself," Bates told them, according to Abdul-Jabbar and Walton's book. The harassment stopped.But three months later after the unit was sent to Camp Hood in Texas, it picked up again. One of the 761st's Black lieutenants, Jack Roosevelt Robinson, was threatened with court-martial after refusing to give up his seat in the front of an Army bus. Once again, Bates intervened and got the charges dropped. Bates' superiors, however, transferred Robinson to another battalion where the charges were reinstated. He was later acquitted. The lieutenant's transfer to the new unit may well have saved his life, since it meant that he was not sent overseas with the 761st, which suffered horrendous casualties. Years later, Robinson, who everyone called Jackie, broke baseball's color line.  In August 1944, two months after D-Day, the 761st was sent to England. Like many other soldiers and civilians at the time, the men of 761st believed the war would soon be over and that they would not see any fighting. But Patton's drive toward the German heartland was stalled in the Saar region of northwest France. Patton needed more tanks. He sent for the 761st, telling them, "I don't care what color you are as long as you go up there and kill those Kraut sons of bitches." During the Saar campaign, Sgt. Ruben Rivers was severely wounded when his tank hit a mine. Shrapnel cut his leg to the bone from his knee to his ankle. But Rivers refused a direct order from his superior officer to evacuate, telling him, "This is one order, the only order I'll ever disobey." Rivers commandeered another tank and positioned it to cover the retreat of armor and infantry that were getting mauled by artillery and anti-tank fire. Two enemy shells ripped into his tank, killing him instantly. All told, the 761st spent 183 consecutive days on the front lines, fighting in France, Belgium, Germany and Austria. They freed 30 towns, four airfields and three large ammo dumps. They captured or destroyed 34 tanks, 113 large guns and thousands of weapons. They rescued fleeing prisoners, like Blinken's stepfather, liberated the concentration camp Gunskirchen, a sub-camp of Mauthausen, and freed potential Holocaust victims, like the poet Sonia Weitz, who wrote a poem celebrating her rescuers:"A black GI stood by the door(I never saw a black before)He'll set me free before I die,I thought, he must be the Messiah."The United States, however, did not completely share Weitz's appreciation. Despite the heroism of units such as the 761st Tank Battalion, the Tuskegee Airmen, the 333rd Field Artillery which played a pivotal role during the Battle of the Bulge or the Black Marines who fought pitched battles against the Japanese on the island of Saipan, decades went by and no Black soldier serving during World War II received the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military award.That oversight was rectified in 1997 -- 52 years after the war's end -- when Rivers and six other Black soldiers received the award."Today, America is profoundly thankful for the patriotism and the nobility of these men and for the example they set, which helped us to find the way to become a more just, more free nation," President Bill Clinton said in presenting the medals posthumously. "They helped America to become more worthy of them and more true to its ideals." It is, perhaps, these ideals that Antony Blinken sought to invoke with the remarkable story of Samuel Pisa and his Black saviors.London  (CNN) - The UK's Culture Secretary has called on Netflix to put a disclaimer at the start of episodes of "The Crown" telling viewers that the royal drama is "a work of fiction."Oliver Dowden said that without a warning that the show uses artistic license, younger viewers might "mistake fiction for fact."The current season of the show, which premiered on Netflix earlier this month, depicts a tumultuous period of Queen Elizabeth II's rule in the 1980s and presents an often unflattering view of members of the family.But Dowden's suggestion was criticized by some historians, many of whom deemed it unnecessary. The minister told the UK's Mail on Sunday newspaper: "It's a beautifully produced work of fiction, so as with other TV productions, Netflix should be very clear at the beginning it is just that." Netflix does not usually inform viewers that its dramas are fictional at the beginning of each episode."Without this, I fear a generation of viewers who did not live through these events may mistake fiction for fact," Dowden added.The paper said the minister is expected to write to the platform to formally request a "health warning" before every episode.CNN has contacted Netflix and the UK's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport for comment."The Crown" is one of Netflix's flagship series, and has so far depicted the first four decades of Elizabeth II's rule over the course of four seasons. Its current season portrays the early romance and eventual breakdown of Prince Charles' marriage to Diana, Princess of Wales, showing the prince continuing a relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles while married to Diana. Other events featured include the rule of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the declining mental health of the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, and the monarch's relationship with her husband, Prince Philip, and their children.Dowden's call for a disclaimer came after a similar suggestion by Earl Spencer, Diana's brother."I think it would help 'The Crown' an enormous amount if, at the beginning of each episode, it stated that: 'This isn't true but it is based around some real events,'" he told ITV last week.A handful of royal biographers and journalists have in the past criticized the show for deviating from the facts, though its creator, Peter Morgan, has never claimed it is completely accurate and the opaque nature of the royal family has made independent retelling of its recent history difficult.The idea of a disclaimer was derided by some historians. "Netflix already tell people that The Crown is fiction. It's billed as a drama. Those people in it are actors. I know! Blows your mind," Alex von Tunzelmann wrote on Twitter."As a historian of Scotland, working in the shadow of Braveheart, Outlander, and all the rest, I find the pearl-clutching over The Crown distorting history *adorable*," added Scottish historian Allan Kennedy, drawing comparisons with the depiction of that country's past in popular media.Editor's Note: David A.

View more opinion at CNN.(CNN) - The assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, Iran's leading nuclear weapons scientist, could set off a tinder box of violence between Iran, Israel and the United States -- and put the incoming Biden administration in a tight spot when it comes to resetting relations with Tehran. In the wake of Fakhrizadeh's death Friday, Iran's foreign minister, in a tweet, called the death "cowardice -- with serious indications of Israeli role," while the Iranian Armed Forces chief of staff warned of "severe revenge" against the scientist's killers. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had no immediate comment, though it's likely he, along with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, discussed how to work against Iran in a meeting in Neom, Saudi Arabia, last Sunday, where Mossad head Yossi Cohen was also present. (One of Netanyahu's confidants, Israeli cabinet minister Tzachi Hanegbi, said Saturday he had "no clue" who was behind the killing.) According to Amos Yadlin, the executive director of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies, it's likely the three sides were planning what moves to make before a Biden administration takes office and reengages with Iran. (Saudi Arabia's foreign minister denied the meeting took place). It's also worth mentioning that Fakhrizadeh's assassination follows the pattern of other Mossad attacks on senior officials in the Iranian nuclear program. Saturday, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani blamed Israel for the killing, but promised a response only at "the right time." Still, the circumstances of the attack -- Fakhrizadeh's car was ambushed in daylight just east of the capital -- had to be horrifying and deeply embarrassing to Iran. The nation's inability to protect itself from a strike in its heartland would seem to make it that much more difficult for moderates in Iran to exercise restraint as the country gears up for presidential election in June 2021. It remains unclear whether the United States had any prior knowledge of the attack. Early this month, President Donald Trump asked senior advisers to explore the possibilities for an offensive strike against Iran's main nuclear site, according to The New York Times, after the International Atomic Energy Agency issued a report that said Iran's stockpile of uranium was 12 times the limit set under the Iran nuclear deal, from which Trump withdrew in 2018. At that meeting, Vice President Mike Pence and Pompeo, along with other aides, warned that such action could lead to a much broader conflict with potentially horrific consequences for the United States. Following the attack on Fakhrizadeh, Trump retweeted an Israeli journalist, who wrote, "(Fakhrizadeh) was head of Iran's secret military program and wanted for many years by Mossad. His death is a major psychological and professional blow for Iran."  The timing of Fakhrizadeh's death is notable. The United States is entering a potentially dangerous period as the anniversary nears of the death of Qasem Soleimani, a top Iranian general, in a US drone strike in Iraq, January 3. Iran's Revolutionary Guard officers, along with many Iranians who revered the leader, believed Tehran's response -- a single missile strike on two US military facilities with enough warning to avoid any casualties -- was weak. Now, the assassination of Fakhrizadeh, who, like Soleimani, was a member of the Revolutionary Guard, only throws more fuel on a fire that Netanyahu, for one, seems to have little interest in extinguishing. After all, there was no apparent indication Fakhrizadeh was planning an immediate operation that could have threatened either Israel or America. The attack -- which may have been timed to take place in the final weeks of Trump's presidency -- could spell trouble for the Biden administration. The President-elect is eager to re-enter the Iran nuclear agreement, and a violent Iranian reprisal might scupper the chance at renewed negotiations before Biden even enters office.Iran will have to weigh competing priorities as it looks ahead. The radical Revolutionary Guard, still smarting over the assassination of Soleimani, will likely call for swift action. But there are also moderates who may be open to cooperating with the incoming Biden administration in a desperate bid to remove the bootheel of sanctions from the nation's economy as it struggles with the Covid-19 pandemic.The key unanswered question is whether Iran will be able to restrain its reflexive impulses to retaliate for Fakhrizadeh's death. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who was seen weeping at Soleimani's funeral, is believed to have close ties to the Revolutionary Guard, which has been instrumental in keeping him in power for more than 30 years. He has already called for revenge and vowed to continue the country's "scientific" activities in a veiled reference to the country's nuclear activities. But Iranian leaders may also heed moderate forces in the interest of encouraging Biden's hope of returning to the nuclear agreement and relief from sanctions.Will Iran direct its wrath against the United States or focus on retaliating against Israel in response to Fakhrizadeh's killing? And then, the broader question: If Iran does retaliate against Israel, will it respond in kind? At least Saturday's comments from Rouhani raise the hope that there may actually be some adults in the room. They may well be capable of exercising the kind of restraint that could allow the incoming Biden administration to move toward a restoration of the nuclear agreement and a control over any Iranian inclination to rush full-tilt toward a bomb.Above all, it is imperative for Trump to exercise restraint rather than escalate what is already a tense situation. Biden has already signaled on numerous occasions that he will abide by the tradition that there is only one president in charge at a time. But if Trump decides to dive headfirst into this dangerous conflict, Biden and his new national security team will have to be prepared to face a world of hurt when they step into the White House this January. Washington  (CNN) - President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on Sunday announced an all-female White House senior communications team, including former Obama White House communications director Jen Psaki as press secretary."I am proud to announce today the first senior White House communications team comprised entirely of women. These qualified, experienced communicators bring diverse perspectives to their work and a shared commitment to building this country back better," Biden said in a statement. Kate Bedingfield, who served as deputy campaign manager and communications director for the campaign, will be White House communications director. Pili Tobar, who served as the communications director for coalitions on the campaign, will serve as deputy White House communications director. Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser on the Biden campaign who later served as chief of staff to Harris, will serve as principal deputy press secretary. Symone Sanders, a senior Biden adviser on the campaign, will serve as a senior adviser and chief spokesperson for the vice president. Ashley Etienne, a senior adviser on the Biden campaign, will serve as communications director for the vice president. Elizabeth Alexander, a Biden campaign senior adviser, will serve as communications director for first lady Jill Biden. These seven women, several of whom are women of color, will occupy some of the most visible roles in the administration. Harris, who will make history as the country's first female vice president, described the newly-announced team as "experienced, talented, and barrier-shattering." "Our country is facing unprecedented challenges — from the coronavirus pandemic to the economic crisis, to the climate crisis, and a long-overdue reckoning over racial injustice. To overcome these challenges, we need to communicate clearly, honestly, and transparently with the American people, and this experienced, talented, and barrier-shattering team will help us do that. These communications professionals express our commitment to building a White House that reflects the very best of our nation," Harris said in a statement. Psaki, a former CNN political commentator, was also a State Department spokesperson during the Obama administration, and previously served as deputy White House communications director and deputy White House press secretary. She has worked on three presidential campaigns, including as traveling press secretary for the 2008 Obama-Biden campaign and traveling press secretary and senior adviser for the 2012 campaign, and as deputy press secretary for John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign. Bedingfield worked at the White House under the Obama administration as Biden's communications director. She previously worked at the Motion Picture Association of America, where she was the vice president of corporate communications. Bedingfield was also the spokeswoman for John Edwards' 2008 presidential campaign, and the communications director for Sen.

(CNN) - The Baltimore Ravens could learn the fate of their Tuesday night game Monday following another round of Covid-19 testing. The Ravens' game against the Pittsburgh Steelers has been postponed twice because of multiple members of the Ravens organization testing positive for coronavirus. The teams were supposed to play Thanksgiving night, but the game was moved to Sunday and then again to Tuesday night.A league source told CNN medical advisers may clear the Ravens to practice on Monday depending on the test results. Those results would also affect if the team travels to Pittsburgh Monday night or Tuesday.According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, who cited an unnamed source, the Ravens were scheduled to hold their first full practice in over a week on Monday morning only for it to be canceled by the NFL. The NFL neither confirmed nor denied the cancellation when asked by CNN. The Ravens have not replied to CNN's request for comment.There are over 20 Ravens players on the Reserve/Covid-19 list, according to the team's website. The NFL describes the Reserve/Covid-19 list as being for players who either test positive for Covid-19 or who have been quarantined after having been in close contact with an infected person or persons.(CNN) - The US Navy has decided to de-commission and scrap the USS Bonhomme Richard after a damage assessment found that restoring the ship would cost billions of dollars. The amphibious assault ship was in port in San Diego in July so that it could be upgraded to accommodate the new Marine Corps F-35B jets when a massive fire broke out aboard the vessel in one of the costliest conflagrations in modern Navy history.Navy officials said that restoring the ship would cost $2.5 billion to $3.2 billion and take five to seven years, saying that some 60% of the vessel would need to be replaced. "Following an extensive material assessment in which various courses of action were considered and evaluated, we came to the conclusion that it is not fiscally responsible to restore her," Secretary of the Navy Kenneth Braithwaite said in a statement.The Navy also looked at how much it would cost to convert what remains of the Bonhomme Richard into another type of vessel, such as a hospital ship, but such a conversion could cost over $1 billion -- more than building a brand-new similar ship. De-commissioning and scrapping the vessel is estimated to cost only $30 million and take nine to 12 months to complete. "We reached the conclusion we needed to de-commission the platform," Rear Admiral Eric Ver Hage, the commander of the Navy Regional Maintenance Center, told reporters on a conference call Monday.Officials said the Navy's top leaders, including the Braithwaite and the Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilda, made the decision last week.  Amphibious assault shipsThe fire aboard the Navy warship was extinguished after raging for four days. Officials say the cause of the fire is still under investigation, but the blaze appears to be one of the costliest in modern Navy history. The USS Bonhomme Richard cost $750 million to build when it was commissioned back in 1998, which amounts to about $1.2 billion in today's dollars. The US Navy no longer builds the class of ship and has replaced it with the newer America class. A new America-class amphibious assault ship costs about $4.1 billion. Amphibious assault ships are designed to support Marine Corps operations, carrying Marines, helicopters and jets that can transport and provide air support to a Marine expeditionary unit.(CNN) - The top official leading the Pentagon's Defeat-ISIS Task Force resigned Monday, becoming the latest senior official to be fired or asked to resign in recent days, part of a White House-directed post-election purge that saw some of the senior-most Defense Department civilians ousted in a matter of days."Today, Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller accepted the resignation of Christopher Maier, the Director of the DoD Defeat-ISIS Task Force," a Pentagon spokesman said in a statement.Maier had led the task force since its inception in March 2017. The task force was responsible for overseeing policy and strategy development as well as international negotiations pertaining to the fight against ISIS. The statement also said the task force director position's duties and responsibilities "will be absorbed" by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict and the regionally focused staffs of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.Loyalists installedThe two offices are currently being led by Ezra Cohen-Watnick and Anthony Tata, individuals perceived as Trump loyalists who have been promoted in the wake of the recent purge.Cohen-Watnick was made the top Pentagon civilian overseeing intelligence, as well as continuing to serve as the acting assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict. The latter position was further enhanced earlier this month when Miller signed a memo that he said made the post "commensurate" with the service secretaries leading the Army, Navy and Air Force.Tata, who failed to obtain Senate confirmation for a top Pentagon policy position, was installed as the top policy official at the Defense Department after his predecessor was forced out the day after President Donald Trump fired then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper. Tata's nomination encountered controversy after it was revealed that he had espoused a series of conspiracy theories.The Defense Department statement Monday said that "these changes recognize the success of the military fight to destroy the so-called physical caliphate of ISIS and reflect DoD's commitment to institutionalize efforts to counter ISIS and integrate efforts with allies and partners within our counterterrorism and regional policy offices."Maier's resignation follows a wave of departures in early November after Trump fired Esper and replaced him with Miller. Alexis Ross, Esper's deputy chief of staff, resigned November 12, joining now-former chief of staff Jen Stewart and the top Pentagon officials overseeing policy and intelligence, all three of whom had submitted their resignations two days earlier.Stewart was replaced by Kash Patel, who most recently served as senior director for counterterrorism at the White House National Security Council and is seen as much more ideological and closely linked to Trump.Retired Navy Vice Adm. Joseph Kernan, the under secretary of defense for intelligence, also left his position and was replaced by Cohen-Watnick. The White House has also moved to clear out an outside advisory group of former high-profile national security officials, acting last Wednesday to jettison former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and Henry Kissinger, former ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee Jane Harman and former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, two officials told CNN. The Defense Policy Board they sat on provides "the Secretary of Defense and the Deputy Secretary of Defense, independent, informed advice and opinions concerning matters of defense policy in response to specific tasks from the Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Secretary of Defense," according to their website.(CNN) - Eleven unprovoked attacks have occurred in the last month in a Massachusetts city, scaring residents and confounding police. Now, the Waltham Police Department is asking for the public's help. The department released footage of a person in a hoodie, their face obscured, who police say is a suspect. The attacks began November 10. The first five occurred near an apartment complex, minutes from Bentley University, but more recent incidents have occurred downtown, Detective Sgt. Steve McCarthy told CNN. As of last week, there have been 11 unprovoked assaults recorded in the city, McCarthy said. The victims were all targeted with a blunt object by an unknown assailant after dark, he said. One victim, who said he was attacked the day before Thanksgiving, is in the hospital with several breaks in his face and skull, CNN Boston affiliate WCVB reported. David Cameros, another victim, told WCVB he was hit in the eye with an unknown object before his attacker ran away. "I don't know if it is only one or there are more attackers," Cameros told WCVB. "The aggressor always attacks from behind."Police told WCVB they're not sure whether the same person committed all 11 assaults. Residents who recognize the person in the video have been asked to contact Waltham police and be aware of their surroundings if they go out at night. Waltham, about 10 miles west of Boston, has about 63,000 residents.(CNN Business) - A version of this article first appeared in the "Reliable Sources" newsletter.

The case counts are getting scarier and the warnings from public health experts are getting more and more dire.At the same time, the prospects for publicly available vaccines are looking better and better. So how should the news media balance the bleak Covid winter with the hopeful news about all the help that's on the way? I asked several experts on Monday and came away with valuable insights."Realism is important," University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor Zeynep Tufekci told me. "The good news is really good, but that doesn't take away from the challenges we still face and the tough winter ahead with surging cases across the nation, overloaded hospitals and overworked health-care workers. So I think it's a matter of being realistic on both counts, the good and the bad."Tufekci has authored several acclaimed pieces about the pandemic this year. Her latest, on Monday, was about the "pandemic heroes who gave us the gift of time and gift of information," helping companies to develop vaccines in record time. Speaking of the vaccines.The 2021 "split screen""If 2020 was one long episode of misery, 2021 will be a split screen," Juliette Kayyemsaid. Kayyem is a homeland security expert, a lecturer at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and a CNN analyst. She said "reporters must continue to expose the tragedy of this pandemic and our government's response, but also capture the glimmering light -- that will be brighter over the months as this distribution rolls across the US, delivering a vaccine in waves -- that will get us to normalish."Kayyem also made the point that "medical stories -- of patients and doctors and the health apparatus -- are so personal, intimate. Supply chain logistics are not." So the story is changing: "We are now pivoting to a story whose success is measured in bulk; it will be messy, and big, and bulky, and rolling over a long time period. These stories are only interesting when something goes wrong: a missed delivery, a power outage that impacts freezing capacity, a person getting a vaccine who shouldn't yet or one who can't. So, it's worth taking a step back and assessing just how much is getting done -- measured in its totality."While the vaccines are rolling out, millions of Americans will still be getting sick. "We have to make it through the next two months," said emergency physician and Brown University professor Dr. Megan Ranney, a relatively new addition to CNN's group of medical analysts. "We have to keep hammering home the message that this is a real disease, and there are real things that we can do to prevent the spread.""You as the media," Ranney said on the phone, "are our best chance of giving a comprehensible and consistent public health message, since our federal government continues to fall down on the job and many state governments continue to fall down on the job.""The road ahead is bound to be tortuous""Covid-19 has never been a one-dimensional story," STAT News co-founder and executive editor Rick Berke pointed out. "For many months, we've seen gradual scientific progress on vaccines and therapeutics even as we've witnessed human tragedy at a breathtaking scale. Journalists have faithfully covered both the hope and the despair.""In that respect," Berke wrote in an email, "news organizations have a responsibility this winter to keep doing what they have since the start of this crisis — cover all elements of the story. Find ways to tell compelling human stories so that the public doesn't lose sight of the incredible toll Covid-19 is taking on the country. And find ways to reflect the promise of vaccines, while rigorously reporting on their rollout. These vaccines are real lights at the end of the tunnel, but they are not panaceas. There are pressing questions about the vaccines themselves, such as how long they will provide immunity, as well as about how they will be distributed and who will get them first."Berke raised some key questions -- ones that news outlets need to keep addressing. Readers and viewers need answers to basic inquiries about the vaccines. "The road ahead is bound to be tortuous," he said, "and it's one journalists need to follow."Another day of record hospitalizationsThis just in from CNN Health's Ben Tinker: "A record 96,039 people in the United States are currently hospitalized with Covid-19, according to data published Monday evening by The COVID Tracking Project. This is the third straight day of new record numbers, following a slight dip reported on Friday. The states with the most people currently hospitalized with Covid-19 are Texas, California, Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania."Read CNN's latest overview story here.But "we can see the shoreline"There's just an awful amount of infection rippling through the United States. The NYT's in-house expert, Donald G. McNeil Jr., is out with a new story titled "The Long Darkness Before Dawn," noting that "the number of deaths is rising and seems on track to easily surpass the 2,200-a-day average in the spring, when the pandemic was concentrated in the New York metropolitan area." McNeil says "our failure to protect ourselves has caught up to us."But his story also describes his "hopeful" view of 2021, thanks to the vaccines on the horizon. Kayyem sounded similarly hopeful -- she told me she was born cautious, but is feeling truly optimistic right now. "As reporters and analysts, I think we can allow ourselves to be," she said. "It's like with sea sickness; the misery seems easier if we can see the shoreline. We can see it." She has even booked a vacation — for this coming August.The need for leadershipOn Monday CNN's Stephen Collinson wrote about a "leaderless America" slipping deep into the Covid winter. President Trump's negligence is only part of the story. Some governors have also been in hiding.I noted on Sunday's "Reliable Sources" that Florida governor Ron DeSantis was refusing to hold press briefings and relying on video messages about Covid-19 instead. On Monday, for what it's worth, he DID hold a Covid briefing for the first time in four weeks. The first question was posed by a reporter who asked, "Where have you been?" CNN's research found that 14 other governors have only held a single Covid-19 press briefing apiece in the month of November. A majority of the governors are Republicans. These men and women need to be front and center right now!We'll never know...I was struck by something that Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said to Bret Baier on "Fox News Sunday." There are "many different things that we could have done differently," Adams said. "This virus has been challenging. I wish that again this hadn't been superimposed on top of an election. I wish that we had been able to come together as a nation and really talk about the science instead of the politics, and that's on all sides, that's all around." The "all sides" comment is a cop-out, but he's right about the terrible timing of this tragedy. We'll never know how different it could have been.(CNN) - When President Donald Trump lost this year's election to Joe Biden, almost nobody around him said they could envision the losing incumbent attending his successor's inauguration.The image remains implausible for a President who will likely never concede and said Sunday that nothing would convince him he lost. Yet Republicans and aides to Trump are encouraging him to at least consider attending Biden's swearing-in, hoping his presence will both reflect well on his character and help preserve his future influence but also convince Americans the election was fair."I hope the President is there on Inaugural Day," Sen. Roy Blunt, the Missouri Republican who is responsible for overseeing January's inauguration, told CNN's Dana Bash on "State of the Union" on Sunday.Blunt, who declined to call Biden the president-elect, still said it was "likely" the former vice president would be sworn in on January 20. He said he was "continuing to work to see what we can do to have both the President there and have Vice President Biden there, likely sworn in on that day."Like others around Trump who are worried his ever-devolving conspiracies about the election could damage both his own standing and the position of Republicans going forward, Blunt appealed to the prospect that Trump could retain more influence if he departs the White House with dignity."I think there's a big role for President Trump," Blunt said. "I hope he embraces that and looks at how you move to whatever comes next for him assuming that this election works out the way it appears it will."MAP: See 2020 election resultsWhether the outgoing president takes that advice remains unknown. Trump has performed none of the traditional steps of an outgoing commander-in-chief, including inviting Biden for a meeting in the Oval Office or even phoning him with any kind of conciliatory message.It took weeks after Biden emerged as the president-elect for the Trump administration to formally begin the presidential transition, causing major concerns about security and planning for the coronavirus vaccine distribution.The transition has now begun, and members of Trump's administration are talking to the Biden team about what to expect when they enter office in January. But Trump hasn't made any attempt to demonstrate good transition etiquette to his underlings as he continues to issue false and baseless claims about voter fraud.Speaking in an interview on Sunday, Trump declined to offer a timeline for when he might ease up his losing battle to overturn the election results. And he admitted that even if Biden enters office, he will remain unconvinced he lost."My mind will not change in six months," he said on Fox.Six months is well past the January 20 inauguration, and a President convinced he is being unfairly ousted seems hardly likely to show up and watch someone else assuming office. Appeals to Trump about preserving Americans' trust in their elections hardly seems like a winning argument for a leader whose entire aim appears to be undermining faith in the Democratic process to discount the fact he lost.Still, one person familiar with the situation says they believe Trump's advisers will strongly encourage him to attend the January 20 inauguration, even if he doesn't concede the election, because it would better preserve his potential influence going forward -- including if he decides to run again in 2024 -- if he doesn't appear like a sore loser.Trump told reporters Thursday that he'd already decided what he was doing on Inauguration Day. "I'll be honest, I know the answer, but I just don't want to say it yet," he said. But aides viewed that as more of a way to put off the question, and did not take it to mean an actual decision had been made.RELATED: Pandemic inauguration could cut the choir, standing-room-only parties and maybe the historic lunchSpeaking on CNN on Sunday, Blunt said he hadn't spoken directly to Trump about attending the inauguration. But he said he was in touch with the President's aides about the best ways to ensure he can continue to be a player in the Republican Party going forward."I have certainly encouraged his staff to look at the transition now, look at the opportunity in Georgia to help us win these Senate seats, look at what the President can do, if the President is leaving the White House, as he says he will do if he loses the Electoral College vote, to help us win back the House in 2022," he said.When Trump was sworn in four years ago, President Barack Obama and the first lady Michelle Obama welcomed him to the White House for coffee before heading to the ceremony. That followed established practice of the outgoing president accommodating the incoming one, a symbolic demonstration of the peaceful transfer of power that has defined American government for more than two centuries.Later, Mrs. Obama admitted the day was difficult for her, particularly because Trump had spread racist lies about her husband's birthplace. But she endured it anyway, she said, because of its importance in maintaining a peaceful transfer.The sitting president typically departs the White House for a final time alongside the incoming one, sharing a ride in the presidential limousine to the US Capitol for the swearing-in ceremony.Later, the newly-former president usually departs Washington for a final time aboard a military helicopter, whisked to Joint Base Andrews for a final ride aboard the aircraft that would have been called Air Force One when they were president.Whether Trump partakes in any of those traditions is now the matter of intense speculation even among his aides, few of whom believe he would carry out any conciliatory moves as he disputes the election's validity.Left behind in the Oval Office is usually a letter from one president to the next, another tradition no one really knows whether Trump will uphold.In the letter Obama wrote to Trump -- reported by CNN in 2017 -- he offered a piece of prescient advice that few could say has been followed."We are just temporary occupants of this office. That makes us guardians of those democratic institutions and traditions -- like rule of law, separation of powers, equal protection and civil liberties -- that our forebears fought and bled for," Obama wrote."Regardless of the push and pull of daily politics," he went on, "it's up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them."(CNN) - President-elect Joe Biden is still weighing who will lead the Central Intelligence Agency, but Tom Donilon is no longer under consideration for the post, CNN has learned.Two sources familiar with the matter say Donilon, a former national security adviser in the Obama administration who had been considered a frontrunner for the job, intends to remain in the private sector and not join the Biden administration. Donilon told the Biden transition team "a while ago" that he was not ready to go back into government right now, one of the sources said.Though Donilon worked more closely with Biden and his team during the Obama administration, his potential role in the incoming administration wouldn't have come without its own complications.As a manager, he was known for creating an intense and tough work environment. Before joining the Obama administration, Donilon was a top Fannie Mae executive for six years during the housing boom, leaving before the company imploded and was forced to pay $400 million to the federal government for misstated earnings during his time there.Since his time in the Obama administration, Donilon has worked for the financial firm BlackRock.CNN reported last week that former acting CIA Director Michael Morell is among those under consideration for the post. Morell isn't known to have a close relationship with Biden but is a 30-year veteran of the CIA and well-respected by the agency rank and file. This story has been updated with additional information about Donilon.(CNN) - After a day picking cranberries at a California farm, Josefino Cervantes Alvarado sat down for dinner to a unique mix of voices and music filling the room. "Greetings to everybody tuning in to Radio Indígena 94.1 FM," said a voice coming from the radio's speakers in Spanish. Moments later, he heard another voice speaking in Mixteco — one of several indigenous languages from southern Mexico."I used to feel ashamed of speaking Mixteco," Cervantes Alvarado, 40, whose first language is Mixteco, said in Spanish. "Whenever I listen to (the radio), I feel proud of who I am and don't want my children to forget that."When the Covid-19 pandemic first hit the United States, the hosts of Radio Indígena were among the first people who could explain Covid-19 to indigenous Mexican farmworkers in Ventura County, thanks to their ability to switch between Spanish, Mixteco and other indigenous languages. As the months passed, they took to debunking coronavirus misinformation.The Mixteco/Indigena Community Organizing Project (MICOP), a group that runs the radio station and helps indigenous families in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, estimates that about 20,000 people from southern Mexico live in the area. Most of them are farmworkers and some only speak their indigenous language. A 2015-2016 national survey by the US Department of Labor indicates that 77% of farmworkers are more comfortable speaking Spanish, 21% English and 1% prefer an indigenous language.  The workers who were interviewed were fluent in at least 10 different indigenous languages. Radio Indígena was created in 2014 as an arm of MICOP to provide information about labor rights and health programs to indigenous Mexican farmworkers in their native languages.  It started streaming shows online and has expanded to FM radio, iOS and Android apps and a call-in number. Currently, the station broadcasts 40 hours of original shows in Spanish and the indigenous languages of Mixteco, Zapoteco and Purépecha. They focus on a variety of topics, including immigrant rights, domestic violence prevention and indigenous history. Genevieve Flores-Haro, associate director for MICOP, estimates that about 3,000 people listen to the station daily. Bernardino Almazán, a producer who used to work picking cilantro, said one of the biggest challenges in the early months of the pandemic was explaining what Covid-19 was. The Mixteco language, he says, dates back at least 2,000 years and does not include modern medical terminology."We had to find other ways to talk about the virus, give examples of similar illnesses, explain the symptoms," Almazán said. The station has since then produced a series of Covid-19 public service announcements about health protocols, school closures, price gauging and mental health.Almazán and his colleagues have found themselves debunking false information and rumors about the cost of Covid-19 tests and the contents of a coronavirus vaccine in development. For example, they had to clarify that undocumented immigrants who seek medical attention due to Covid-19 wouldn't be affected by the "public charge" rule, a federal provision that makes it more difficult for immigrants to obtain legal status if they use public benefits like food stamps and housing vouchers.Another conspiracy theory that the hosts have addressed is whether Microsoft founder Bill Gates wanted to use a potential coronavirus vaccine to implant tracking devices in people. Gates addressed the rumors last July during a CNN global coronavirus town hall."We recommend that they don't pay attention to gossip circulating in social media or to people who may not have accurate information," Francisco Didier Ulloa, the station's coordinator and Almazán's co-host, said in Spanish. "Our duty is to report responsibly." Arcenio López, executive director of MICOP, said Radio Indígena has been crucial to informing indigenous communities in Ventura County about Covid-19. In addition to running the radio station, MICOP connects to the community, largely through door-to-door interactions. That works better than distributing pamphlets because many people who work at California farms come from rural communities in Mexico with widespread Spanish illiteracy. At a Covid-19 testing location, López says, a woman couldn't read her results because the document was only in English and Spanish. She had tested positive for the virus, he said.  The group has since created videos in multiple languages showing how to make a face mask, wash your hands properly and get tested for Covid-19."It would be ideal that everyone learns English but the reality is that there's people that would never learn English and there's people who have just arrived to this country," López said. "All of them deserve to have vital information in their native language, it's a basic human right." Farmworkers are at hightened risk of Covid-19, advocates sayMany of Radio Indígena's listeners are Latinos and farmworkers, two groups that have been disproportionately impacted by coronavirus outbreaks in multiple states. The number of Covid-19 cases among Black and Hispanic children and across all ages is higher than other groups. Black and Hispanic people infected with the virus also died at disproportionately higher rates over the summer.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that farmworkers face a particular risk of infection from being in close contact with one another in fields, in shared housing or transport, and because of limited access to clean water for hygiene.In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order in April that mandates two weeks of paid sick leave for farmworkers or food sector workers subject to a quarantine or isolation order or medical directive. Newsom also allocated $100 million to subsidize child-care costs for essential workers.In Ventura County, the state's Central Coast county of about 850,000 people, Latinos make nearly 45% of the population. As of November 25, there have been 18,394 people infected with Covid-19 there and nearly 54% were Latinos, according to data from county health officials. It's unclear how many people are of indigenous Mexican heritage. There have been 496 farmworkers who tested positive for the virus, the county said. Earlier this year, the county's agricultural commission distributed about 1 million face masks to farming sites after a housing facility for farmworkers in Oxnard saw a large Covid-19 outbreak, CNN affiliate KEYT reported.López, MICOP's executive director, said farmworkers have experienced a dramatic loss of work during the pandemic. Those who have jobs struggle with lack of access to handwashing facilities and have to work in close proximity with a large number of people. Many who are employed, he says, feel like they don't have a choice.Some would sleep in cars to avoid exposing their families, López says, and others would be afraid to tell their employers they were sick with Covid-19 because they didn't want to lose their jobs. "If you talk to a farmworker, many would tell you they are just grateful that they have a job because they live paycheck to paycheck," López said. In the past two weeks, advocacy groups have been calling for a committee to develop guidelines for the prioritization and allocation of a Covid-19 vaccine to prioritize farmworkers. "Farm workers must be prioritized and also have access to factual, scientific information about vaccines in the languages and indigenous dialects they speak," said Diana Tellefson Torres, executive director of United Farm Workers Foundation, in a statement.Washington  (CNN) - President-elect Joe Biden has repeatedly promised to build a government that "looks like America." He's not wasting any time in delivering on that front. Biden has moved quickly to name a diverse group to key White House and Cabinet posts.On Sunday night, he unveiled an all-female senior communications staff and is expected to roll out a diverse group to lead his economic team this coming week.The incoming administration is taking shape as the outgoing one has sought to undermine both its legitimacy and ability to deliver on many of Biden's campaign pledges. But the President-elect's early picks are, in themselves, a promise kept -- and provide a stark contrast to those of President Donald Trump, who, despite his appointment of women and minorities to some key positions, assembled a largely White and male group during his nearly four years in office. The heavy presence of Obama alumni in Biden's team also signals continuity from the last Democratic administration.   Biden touted his communications hires in a statement on Sunday night, saying they would "bring diverse perspectives to their work and a shared commitment to building this country back better." Among the group of incoming communications aides is Jen Psaki, who was Obama's White House communications director and will assume the public-facing role of White House press secretary. Kate Bedingfield, who served as deputy campaign manager and communications director on the Biden campaign, comes aboard as the White House's top communications aide.On Monday, Biden is set to formally unveil a list of people he's planning to nominate to key economic roles, including a number of nominees who would represent historic firsts if confirmed by the Senate. Chief among them is Janet Yellen, the President-elect's expected choice to head the Treasury Department. Already the first woman to have chaired the Federal Reserve, Yellen would carry the same distinction if the Senate confirms her as Biden's Treasury secretary.  Biden's set to nominate Adewale "Wally" Adeyemo to serve under Yellen as the deputy Treasury secretary. If confirmed, Adeyemo, the current president of the Obama Foundation in Chicago, would be the first Black person to hold that powerful position.Biden is also planning to name Neera Tanden to lead the Office of Management and Budget, two people familiar with the appointment said. The chief executive of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, and a former top aide to Hillary Clinton, Tanden would be the first woman of color to oversee the agency. In tapping Tanden, Biden risked grumbles from some in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, with whom she has sparred -- mostly over Twitter, where she is an active combatant -- over the past four years.  But the first round of pushback against Tanden's nomination came not from the left, but from the communications director for Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas. "Neera Tanden, who has an endless stream of disparaging comments about the Republican Senators' whose votes she'll need, stands zero chance of being confirmed," Drew Brandewie tweeted on Sunday night.The selection of Cecilia Rouse, a Princeton economist, to lead the Council of Economic Advisers, is less likely to set off fireworks on social media, but it is a historical marker just the same. Rouse will become the first woman of color to chair the council. Last week, Biden announced several other administration picks, including the first woman to lead the US intelligence community, in Avril Haines, and Alejandro Mayorkas, who would be the first Latino and immigrant to helm the Department of Homeland Security. In addition to Psaki and Bedingfield, Biden also announced on Sunday that Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser on the Biden campaign who later served as chief of staff to Harris, will serve as principal deputy press secretary. Jean-Pierre is a progressive favorite and former chief public affairs officer at MoveOn.org, the liberal activist hub. Symone Sanders, who was a senior adviser on Biden's campaign in 2020 after serving as a national press secretary for Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, will join the White House as a senior adviser and chief spokesperson for Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.(CNN) - For many mixed status immigrant families -- like mine -- this post-election period is a time of growing anxiety and fear about what else Donald Trump may do to harm immigrants before he leaves the White House.  It's not an unwarranted fear. It's been reported that the administration has recently been in constant communication with groups that advocate for harsher immigration policies.And Trump's track record also gives us good reason to worry about what could come. From his first moments in office, Trump has used executive action to advance his racist anti-immigrant agenda. During his first week as President, he issued a sweeping travel ban, which mostly included Muslim majority countries and refugees. And there was another executive order making undocumented immigrants, which mostly consist of people of color, immediately deportable. He has moved to take away humanitarian protections or Temporary Protective Status from 300,000 immigrants from Sudan, Nicaragua, Haiti and El Salvador.Living under this administration has put my family's life in limbo. It meant waking up every day fearing that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), now emboldened to be indiscriminate, could show up to the home of my parents, who were undocumented, and separate us. Trump's constant efforts to dismantle DACA has held back my brother, Jonathan, one of the hundreds of thousands of young people who benefitted from the program, from planning for the future and pursuing his dream of opening a martial arts academy for children and youth. It also meant that I feared my citizenship application could be backlogged for a long time or denied because of my activism.  Under the Trump administration, those of us working with immigrant communities increasingly knew of immigrants who were denied their citizenship, and earlier this year the Justice Department officially created a section in its immigration office to strip away citizenship from naturalized immigrants who the Trump administration claimed "illegally obtained naturalization," but lawyers and critics have rightfully been concerned about it being abused by the administration.  I grew up in the United States undocumented, first arriving in 1998 at 13 when my parents fled poverty and violence in Quito, Ecuador. They risked everything. They wanted to make sure I would not only survive here, but also get a chance to pursue dreams unattainable in the place they left behind.But after more than 20 years of living in this country, I became a US citizen. My citizenship application was approved, and I was able to petition for my parents, who after waiting for more than a year, were granted green cards this month. This was a bittersweet moment for our family because though I could petition for my brother, the immigration system only allows a limited number of visas for sibling petitions per year and our application would take 13 years or more to be processed. My story is similar to the stories of millions of immigrants who are here to stay and whose lives were at stake during this election. And while families remain anxious about what the current administration will do on its way out, we are hopeful about what President-elect Joe Biden will do to fix America's unjust immigration system on his way in. But we need to hear more about his agenda to help diminish any fear coming over the immigrant community during Trump's last weeks in office.I voted in my first presidential election this November.  My vote for Biden was a vote for my immigrant parents, for my brother and for all of the other immigrant families impacted by Trump's hateful agenda of deportation, detention and family separation. And many young undocumented immigrants who couldn't vote nevertheless played a big role in the months leading up to Election Day, mobilizing their communities to vote for Biden.Voters have given him a mandate to address the needs of working-class people, including immigrants, who have been hit the hardest by the pandemic and are struggling for survival after four years of Trump.At United We Dream Action, I was proud to help launch and run the largest electoral program ever led by immigrant youth this year. We drove record turnout among low-propensity Latinx, youth, and first-time voters in numerous battleground states, including Arizona, Florida, Texas, Colorado, Minnesota, Michigan and North Carolina. Several of these states were crucial for defeating Trump and carrying Biden across the finish line to victory.  Now, we're calling on him to use the transition period to prepare and announce a series of pro-immigrant executive actions that will happen on day one of his presidency. Ideally, we wouldn't have to rely on Biden's executive power to grant basic human decency for one of the most marginalized groups in this country. The policy changes that would protect immigrant communities permanently and provide a pathway to citizenship can only be done through Congressional action, but Republicans' unwavering embrace of Trump and his policies would certainly make legislative action challenging if they hold on to the Senate after the Georgia runoff election. Nonetheless, the immigrant justice movement will keep up the pressure on Congress for action. The hope for legislative action, however, cannot be used as an excuse for a Biden administration to not take executive action to provide immediate relief for immigrants. We simply can't wait.   With the stroke of his presidential pen, Biden can do many things to empower and protect immigrants, including several measures he has supported during the campaign trail like reversing all of Trump's anti-immigrant executive orders; halting all deportations (Biden has said that he is in favor of doing this temporarily, but it needs to be a lasting measure); closing for-profit immigrant detention facilities; immediately releasing all immigrants from detention centers -- where unsanitary conditions and overcrowding have created the perfect storm for Covid-19 outbreaks -- so that they can reunite with families, friends or be part of non-profit community programs that help to keep families safe while they follow the legal process for their case. Immigrants, mostly of color -- because of systemic racism and an immigration system built to criminalize them -- are being held indefinitely in these facilities for minor violations like driving without a license. Under Trump, detention centers are filled with immigrants who have been criminalized for seeking refuge in this country, living here without papers, traffic stops, and other minor violations.   Biden has promised to reinstate the DACA program, but he should also expand it and implement other measures to protect immigrants from deportation and family separation. Other important measures will require bipartisan support but are just as important for Biden to start talking about now. For one, creating a pathway to citizenship for all, including undocumented workers who are keeping this country running—like farmworkers, meatpacking plant workers and home health aides -- during the pandemic. We need the new administration to act in a way that makes clear that there is no relief for essential workers without immediate relief for undocumented immigrants -- the two are inextricably linked and cannot be separated. That's why Biden should immediately push both Republicans and Democrats in Congress to ensure that future Covid-19 relief bills include help for undocumented immigrants who pay billions of dollars in taxes. The fact that the first relief bill left out millions of immigrants was shameful. We are a crucial part of ensuring that the entire country is on the road to recovery. And if finding funding is an issue,  diverting billions from a cruel and unjust immigration enforcement system to fund federal Covid-19 relief efforts is a great start.  Just as Trump and his Republican enablers have been unapologetic in moving their anti-immigrant agenda, Biden should immediately pursue every executive and legislative path possible to advance justice for immigrants. But we need Biden to be much more than the anti-Trump President.We need him to be the President who rebuilds and leads an America where all people, including immigrants, can live freely and with dignity -- an America where all immigrants become equal partners in making this multi-racial democracy better for everyone.Editor's Note: Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio's daily program "The Dean Obeidallah Show" and a columnist for The Daily Beast. Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.(CNN) - Donald Trump desperately wants you to believe the only reason Joe Biden won the 2020 election by so many votes was because it was the "most fraudulent election in history." Trump served up his latest variation of this fallacy on Fox Business on Sunday morning, saying "we have so much evidence" to support his claims but the judges "won't allow us" to submit it.That's a lie. The truth is Trump's lawyers have had numerous opportunities to present the so-called evidence of voter fraud, but haven't. Why? Simple. There is no such evidence. Trump's own lawyers -- including Rudy Giuliani -- have repeatedly admitted in court cases from Arizona to Pennsylvania that they are not even alleging voter fraud in those lawsuits. The obvious reason being they can't prove the claims. There's a difference between what a client can scream in public and what a lawyer can say to a judge. As a lawyer myself, I know how it's drilled into our heads from law school that you could be disbarred if you intentionally lie to a judge. We have a "special duty as officers of the court" to be truthful to the court. Hence, Trump says one thing to the media and his lawyers tell a vastly different story to the courts. As a nation, we should actually be grateful Trump's campaign filed lawsuits in countless states. If Trump hadn't, the fact-checking would have been done primarily by the very journalists Trump has slammed for years as "enemies of the people." But by filing these legal actions, the people who have ruled that Trump's claims are baseless are judges across the political spectrum -- including one Trump nominated to the federal bench in 2017, Judge Stephanos Bibas.  In fact, Bibas, joined by Judges David Brooks Smith and Michael Chagares, both GOP-appointed judges to the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, wrote the unanimous decision released Friday that was a master class in decimating Trump's claims of voter fraud. The court first slammed Trump's efforts to overturn the election results in Pennsylvania, a state Biden won by more than 80,000 votes, writing, "Voters, not lawyers, choose the President. Ballots, not briefs, decide elections." The judges then reached the crux of Trump's claims of voter fraud, declaring that: "Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here." In fact, as the opinion stated, "The Campaign never alleges that any ballot was fraudulent or cast by an illegal voter," reiterating later that the Trump campaign "conceded that it is not alleging election fraud." So despite Trump's non-stop cries of voter fraud, when it came to the lawsuit, there was not even a claim of such wrongdoing. In fact, Giuliani admitted that in open court last week while appearing before federal Judge Matthew Brann in Pennsylvania.  "This is not a fraud case," Giuliani said in response to Brann's questioning.  This helps explain why, for example, while Trump repeatedly claims publicly that "dead people" voted in Pennsylvania -- even repeating that falsehood last Wednesday when he called into a news conference held in Gettysburg by a handful of Pennsylvania GOP state legislators -- Trump's lawyers conceded in another lawsuit in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that there was "no evidence" a ballot was cast by "a deceased person." Lawyers in general won't risk being disbarred to help a client by lying to the court.We've seen similar outcomes in connection with campaign lawsuits filed in other battleground states that Trump lost. In Arizona, Trump's lawyer Kory Langhofer filed a lawsuit to contest the results that Biden had won the state. But Langhofer didn't parrot Trump's claims of voter fraud. Rather, he argued that a "limited number" of ballots should be reviewed because it appeared there were "good faith errors" in operating machines. "This is not a fraud case," said Langhofer. "We're not alleging anyone's stealing the election." That lawsuit was ultimately dropped by the Trump campaign since they admitted the claims wouldn't change the fact Biden won. In Michigan, the Trump campaign voluntarily dropped its lawsuit alleging voter fraud -- falsely claiming it dropped the lawsuit because it had succeeded at stopping the certification of the election results in Michigan's Wayne County. It hadn't; the results were certified in accordance with Michigan law. Trump can keep repeating his claims the election was "rigged," "fake," a "hoax" ... yadda, yadda, yadda. After four-plus years of Trump, we all know his go-to buzzwords. The truth is that Trump has been given his day in court to prove his case and he has failed -- over and over. Thanks to these lawsuits, it's clear that at this point the only fraud in the 2020 election is Donald Trump.(CNN) - Part of Jennifer Lawrence's family farm in Kentucky, which also operates a summer camp, was destroyed by a fire over the weekend, according to a statement from the camp. "It is with the heaviest of hearts that we confirm the news that we lost our barn last night in a horrible fire. We are deeply thankful that no people or animals were hurt, but we are still mourning the loss of years of hard work and memories that occurred in these walls," Camp Hi-Ho wrote in a statement posted to Facebook. "Words cannot describe the pain we are in, but we are so incredibly grateful for the Simpsonville Fire Department and all the other fire fighters who responded to our emergency. You are true heroes."According to local WYKL News, 30 firefighters and six trucks were called to the scene on Friday evening.The camp is owned and directed by Lawrence's brother, Blaine."We know Camp Hi-Ho is a special place to so many, and we plan to rebuild and repair so that we can move forward with a safe and joyful camp experience this summer," the statement concluded.(CNN) - Iran's top nuclear scientist was killed Friday in the outskirts of Tehran, once again setting the Middle East on edge and threatening to bring further turmoil to the region.Here's what you need to know.What happened? Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, believed to be the mastermind of Iran's controversial nuclear program, was in a car east of Tehran when he was shot dead on Friday afternoon. While there are conflicting reports on how the attack unfolded, most accounts agree that it was a sophisticated attack with gunfire and an explosion. But at least one account offered even more dramatic claims.The semi-official Fars News Agency claimed on Sunday that Fakhrizadeh was traveling with his wife in a bulletproof car, alongside three security personnel vehicles, when he heard what sounded like bullets hitting a vehicle and got out of his car to find out what happened.At that point, a remote-controlled machine gun opened fire from a Nissan stopped about 150 meters (164 yards) from Fakhrizadeh's car, Fars claimed. The scientist was hit at least three times and the Nissan exploded after the attack. Weapons experts say the claim is technically possible. But experts agree it is unlikely that those behind the assassination would choose this method because of its high risk of failure. Iranian news agencies have also offered contradictory versions of events. It is also possible that Iranian authorities are trying to exaggerate the sophistication of the attack to play down the glaring weakness of its security apparatus exposed by the assassination in broad daylight of one of its top officials. The killing has left Iran feeling exposed and vulnerable. Who was he and why was he important? In 2015, the Obama administration clinched a landmark deal to curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, but it was short-lived. In 2018, Trump pulled out of the pact and meted out some of the most crippling sanctions Tehran has ever been subjected to. A year later, Iran resumed enriching uranium, and took other steps to reactivate its nuclear program. This alarmed Western capitals but experts believe Iran is still years away from developing a nuclear weapon. While Fakhrizadeh was a key player in Iran's nuclear program, he was an old hand, so his expertise is unlikely to have died with him. Who did it? Iran has blamed Israel for the attack and said the operation bore the hallmarks of Israel's foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad. While Iran has provided no evidence of Israeli involvement, Israel has neither denied nor claimed responsibility for Fakhrizadeh's death. In 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Fakhrizadeh was the head of Project Amad, which he and others describe as a secret nuclear weapons endeavor. "Remember that name, Fakhrizadeh," the prime minister told reporters at the time.  Shortly after the assassination, US President Donald Trump retweeted Israeli journalist Yossi Melman, who wrote that Fakhrizadeh "was head of Iran's secret military program and wanted for many years by Mossad." What has Iran said, and what does it mean for the nuclear deal?In January, Iran fired several rounds of ballistic missiles at US positions in nearby Iraq, but gave troops advance warning, enabling them to take cover in bunkers. But in addition to that, a military error that night led to the shooting down of a Ukrainian commercial plane that had taken off from Tehran's international airport, killing 176 people on board.Iran's restraint after Soleimani's killing was seen as part and parcel of President Hassan Rouhani's policy of "strategic patience." For years, Iranians have been banking on a Democrat returning to the White House -- and they are counting on US President-elect Joe Biden to make good on his promise to restore the nuclear deal.What happens to the nuclear deal hinges on Iran's response to this assassination. If Iran retaliates now and sets off a conflict, it would make it more difficult for all sides to get back to the negotiating table next year.But Iran's patience is wearing thin. Its economy has suffered under unrelenting sanctions and its top leadership was dealt repeated blows in recent years. Among lawmakers, calls for retaliation are growing louder, and Tehran's deterrent powers have been greatly diminished by expectations of restraint.Whether or not Tehran retaliates, it has much to lose, and it will tread carefully. Hong Kong  (CNN Business) - Unilever has become the latest major company to hop on the four-day work week bandwagon, lending credence to the idea that flexible working is here to stay.On Tuesday, the distributor of Lipton's tea, Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream announced it would test shorter working hours for all its employees in New Zealand, letting them decide which four days they'd prefer to work each week.The trial starts this month, and runs for a year. The consumer giant has 81 staff members in the country, who will be allowed to work compressed schedules with full pay as the University of Technology Sydney in Australia helps track their progress.Unilever said that if all goes well, the company will consider whether to shake up its workflow on a wider scale."We hope the trial will result in Unilever being the first global company to embrace ways of working that provide tangible benefits for staff and for business," Nick Bangs, managing director of Unilever New Zealand, said in a statement. "This is an exciting moment for our team and a validation of the catalytic role Covid-19 has played in shaking up standard working practices." Unilever isn't the first firm to adopt the practice in New Zealand. In 2018, local company Perpetual Guardian, which helps customers manage their wills and estates, also held a widely cited two-month trial of the concept. The firm said it was so successful, it later decided to make it permanent.Bangs said that his team was inspired by the findings from that case study, and had started to "believe the old ways of working are outdated."Even New Zealand's leader, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, has raised the idea as one that might help the economy recover from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.In May, Ardern shared the suggestion while discussing ways to revive domestic tourism in her country. She said that while businesses had their own discretion to make such decisions, the idea had merit in that it might give domestic travelers "flexibility in terms of their travel and their leave."Big companies elsewhere are also starting to join the trend. Last year, Microsoft's team in Japan experimented by shutting down its offices every Friday in August, and giving all employees an extra day off each week.The results were promising: While the amount of time spent at work was cut dramatically, productivity — measured by sales per employee — went up by almost 40% compared to the same period the previous year, the company said.As a result, Microsoft announced that it would follow up with another experiment in Japan, and also asked other companies to join the initiative.Four-day work weeks have been touted as a way to improve work-life balance. Some businesses recently started trying it out to help fight burnout caused by the challenges of working during the pandemic.Other companies are leaning into remote working for similar reasons. On Tuesday, Japanese firm Nomura Holdings said that it was considering introducing a new arrangement, which would allow workers to spend up to 60% of their time away from the office each month.(CNN) - Pharmaceutical company Moderna intends to apply Monday to the US Food and Drug Administration for authorization of its Covid-19 vaccine.   The company will ask the FDA to review an expanded data set showing the vaccine is 94.1% effective at preventing Covid-19 and 100% effective at preventing severe cases of the disease.   "This is striking," said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory committee. "These are amazing data."   Moderna's chief medical officer said he became emotional when he saw the data Saturday night.   "It was the first time I allowed myself to cry," Dr. Tal Zaks said. "We have a full expectation to change the course of this pandemic."  Moderna will become the second company to apply to the FDA for emergency use authorization for a coronavirus vaccine. Pfizer applied on November 20 with data showing similarly high efficacy.   The FDA will meet with its advisory committee in December to review Pfizer's and Moderna's applications.   The first vaccinations in the United States are expected to take place "towards the latter part of December," according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.   Moderna's new data  On Monday, Moderna released updated efficacy data for its Phase 3 clinical trial.   Starting in July, Moderna gave either its vaccine or a placebo -- a shot of saline that does nothing -- to some 30,000 people in the United States. With high rates of coronavirus throughout the country over the next following months, many of those study subjects developed Covid-19.  But there was a big difference between the group that got the vaccine and the group that got the placebo.   Among the approximately 15,000 people who received the vaccine, 11 developed Covid-19.   Among the approximately 15,000 people who received the placebo, 185 developed Covid-19.   That amounts to a 94.1% efficacy for Moderna's vaccine.   None of the 11 people who received the vaccine became severely ill, but 30 of the 185 who received the placebo became severely ill, and one of them died.   The vaccine had similar efficacy rates for elderly people and for people in racial minority groups, Zaks said.   In Pfizer's Phase 3 clinical trial, the vaccine proved to be 95% effective, and one study participant who received the vaccine developed a severe case of Covid-19.   While the two vaccines are not identical, both Pfizer and Moderna use messenger RNA to illicit an immune response in the human body. The vaccines are given in two doses a few weeks apart, and can cause side effects, such as a fever or body aches for a few days.   Next steps  The FDA is scheduled to meet with its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee on December 10 to review Pfizer's application and on December 17 to review Moderna's application.   Offit, who is a member of that panel, said it will be important to look and see why some people still got Covid-19 even after being vaccinated.   "Were they more likely to be older? Were they more likely to be African-American or obese or have underlying medical problems like diabetes?" said Offit, a vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania.   If the FDA grants the vaccine emergency use authorization -- and it's expected that it will -- within a day or two, an advisory committee to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will make a recommendation about who should get the shots first. That group will likely include health care workers and nursing home residents.   After the CDC issues those recommendations, shots can go into arms.   Zaks said as the pandemic rages on, he looks forward to seeing the vaccines in action.   By the end of 2020, Moderna expects to have approximately 20 million doses of its vaccine available in the United States, and it's on track to manufacture 500 million to 1 billion doses globally next year, according to the company's press release Monday.   "The magnitude of this achievement and the implications of what it means to what's ahead of us in the context of what's going on around us is -- it's just overwhelming emotionally," Zaks said.  (CNN) - While her peers may still be learning to drive, Marsai Martin has reached a different kind of milestone. Martin, who is known for playing Diane on ABC's "Black-ish," has broken a Guinness World Record as the youngest Hollywood executive producer to work on a major production. "It feels crazy, honestly," Martin said in a video of her certificate presentation. "A world record? That's insane." Although Martin is now 16 years old, she technically broke the record in 2019, as a result of her work on the film "Little." She just wasn't presented with this award -- and officially declared a record-breaker by Guinness -- until now. Along with producing, Martin also played a lead role in the film alongside actors Regina Hall and Issa Rae. In "Little," a tech entrepreneur, played by Hall, wakes up in the body of her former 13-year-old self, played by Martin. "To be able to create a film, to star in it and be with your favorite stars, and actually seeing that entire experience was so amazing," Martin said during the certificate presentation. Martin reportedly pitched the idea for the film herself to "Black-ish" producer Kenya Barris, who also served as one of the producers of "Little," when she was 10. After the pitch was accepted, Martin signed a deal with Universal Pictures, developing scripted projects, in 2019. Although she was not presented with the award until this year, the record acknowledges that she was 14 years and 241 days old when "Little" was released."She is not only tremendously talented in front of the camera, but offers a unique perspective as a creator and producer that will resonate with all audiences," Peter Cramer, president of Universal Pictures, said in a statement to CNN. Martin will appear in the 2021 edition of the physical Guinness World Records book. In the meantime, Marsai's production company, Genius Productions, is currently working on another film, "StepMonster." (CNN) - While many health care workers have used social media to show Americans the harsh effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, one Oregon nurse is in trouble for doing the opposite.An oncology nurse at Oregon's Salem Health was suspended Saturday after she posted a TikTok video in which she bragged about flouting her state's pandemic restrictions, the hospital told CNN.The video, which has since been taken down, showed the nurse, wearing scrubs and a stethoscope around her neck, pretending to scream with a caption that read: "When my coworkers find out I still travel, don't wear a mask when I am out, and let my kids have playdates." The video, posted Friday, went viral, and at least one other TikTok user posted a version of it to their account -- which has received hundreds of thousands of views. The video "displayed cavalier disregard for the seriousness of this pandemic and her indifference towards physical distancing and masking outside of work," the hospital said in a statement posted to Facebook on Saturday. The hospital went on to distance themselves from the nurse's comments, saying "We also want to assure you that this one careless statement does not reflect the position of Salem Health or the hardworking and dedicated caregivers who work here."The hospital said the nurse will be on administrative leave until an investigation that "will thoroughly and accurately ascertain the facts in this case" is complete.CNN affiliate KPTV said it sent a crew to the nurse's home to get a comment but she declined. CNN has not been able to reach her for comment. The video comes as Oregon has been experiencing a surge in Covid-19 cases over the past few weeks, setting records in the number of new cases of the disease just last weekend. Plus, Marion County, the home of Salem Health, has had some of the highest numbers of cases in Oregon, while the hospital itself is fifth on Oregon Health Authority's list of workplaces with employee-related cases.Oregon's latest weekly report on the pandemic reported that Salem Hospital has had 91 employee-related positive Covid-19 cases, though the state includes family members of employees who test positive in these numbers as well.(CNN Business) - A version of this article first appeared in the "Reliable Sources" newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.Trump is Trump. There's nothing new to say about the outgoing president. But there is still lots to learn about his enablers. So many people, from GOP functionaries to Fox News hosts, are helping him to undermine democracy by denying the election and attacking reality. So many people are complicit.People like Maria Bartiromo. Formerly an acclaimed journalist, known around the world for making CEOs tell the truth, she now tees up Trump to recite lie after lie. Her Sunday morning call with Trump on Fox News was his first "interview" since he lost the election, but it wasn't a real interview at all. He wasn't ready to acknowledge that he lost, and neither was she. He displayed delusional weakness. She was complicit. And she's far from the only one.GOP leaders stay silentThis is what Ron Brownstein on CNN Sunday night: As Trump's conspiracy theory about the "rigged" election "gets more and more fantastical and far-reaching, implicating the DOJ, the FBI, and Republican governors, the silence of Republicans in Congress — Mitch McConnell in particular, Kevin McCarthy in particular, who are allowing this poison to spread in the American political system — looks more and more like a modern analogue to the silence of Republican congressional leaders during the rampages of Joe McCarthy in the early 1950s."Brownstein added, "I think history will have no trouble finding a parallel between Mitch McConnell's efforts to kind of look the other way and what so many Republican leaders did until Joseph Welch said, at long last, sir 'have you no decency?'"Trump is backslidingHe lost the election nearly four weeks ago yet he refuses to admit it. Judging by his tweets, he's spiraling even deeper into denial. The Bartiromo interview was a sign that he's prepared to do battle in public -- a disturbing display of weakness that some people interpret as strength. His Thanksgiving evening Q&A with reporters was another sign of the same thing. After holding a call with members of the military, he fielded questions for the first time in three weeks, though he mostly just deflected and distorted the truth. When he walked out, one reporter asked "Is this the language of a dictator?" and another said, "Mr. President, some people say you're denying reality."On Sunday's "Reliable Sources," author Jonathan Rauch, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, placed Trump's recent statements in the context of information warfare.Trump is running a "classic Russian-style disinformation campaign," known as the "firehose of falsehood," he said.In this propaganda model, "you push out as many different stories and conspiracy theories and lies and half-truths as you possibly can, in order to flood the zone with disinformation," Rauch said. "The goal here is to confuse people, and he's doing very well at that. This is a classic propaganda tactic. He is very good at it."Rauch pointed out that the falsehoods don't have to be consistent or logical. "It's about throwing spaghetti against the wall," he said. "It's anything and everything. It can be wild. It can be random. It's to create confusion and epistemic chaos. And that's what we are seeing.""And that's very hard for democracies to deal with," he added. "Traditionally, we dealt with it by not doing it. It was unthinkable before Trump for anyone to run this kind of disinformation campaign from the White House against the American public. Once it happens, I think the best defense to start with is for people, at least a lot of people, to understand what's going on, to realize what's happening here."Craig Mazin, the creator of HBO's "Chernobyl," reacted to Rauch's remarks by reprising one of the most memorable lines from his series: "The real danger is that if we hear enough lies, then we no longer recognize the truth at all."The Murdochs own thisTrumpism is a big part of Fox's business model. The men who control Fox, Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, were evidently pleased enough by Bartiromo's propaganda, proud enough of her Trump sycophancy, that they rebroadcast her 10 a.m. Eastern time hour at 3 p.m. on Sunday.Right afterward, at 4 p.m., news anchor Eric Shawn matter-of-factly dismantled what Trump and Bartiromo had just built. (No wonder why Trump keeps attacking Fox's weekend news anchors.)Shawn said Trump "doubled down on his claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 elections even though local and national election officials as well as federal and state courts in multiple states -- and in some cases the Trump campaign's own lawyers -- have said there is no evidence to prove that." He added, "Experts say such claims are simply unsupported falsehoods that are not backed up by any facts."That's clear, convincing language from Shawn. So then why did Fox broadcast all of Trump's claims without any real-time followups? A Fox News spokesperson did not respond to my inquiries.Trump said Hannity 'gets it,' but...During the Sunday morning phoner with Bartiromo, Trump praised Mark Levin's show "last night," even though Saturday's airing was just a repeat of a six-day-old episode of Levin's show. He also said "Sean Hannity, he knows, he gets it. He gets it." Meaning... what? That Hannity believes Trump won the election?On Sunday night, Hannity posted a tweet that said the media helped "drive Trump from office," which was notable primarily for his admission that Trump's presidency is over. To understand some of the rage and election denialism on the far-right, take a look at the replies to Hannity's tweet.A few days ago I quoted a longtime on-air staffer at Fox saying that "our audience has absolutely been radicalized," and that's what a lot of this is about: The audience. Bartiromo's Sunday morning show has a much bigger audience than the Fox newscasts later in the day.The irony is richCNN senior media reporter Oliver Darcy writes: "If you've watched Fox News over the past week, you've no doubt seen a segment or two assailing reporters for lobbing supposed 'softball' questions at Biden. These segments have dominated Fox's talk shows lately. Which made Bartiromo's 'interview' a display of astounding double standards and heaps of hypocrisy. Think about Bartiromo's 'interview' the next time Fox has the nerve to attack reporters for the questions they ask Biden or members of his forthcoming administration."New York  (CNN Business) - Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the outlook for the United States economy is "extraordinarily uncertain" as the rise in Covid-19 cases continues to take an economic toll on the country."As we have emphasized throughout the pandemic, the outlook for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend, in large part, on the success of efforts to keep the virus in check." Powell said in prepared remarks for his testimony on Tuesday to the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. "The rise in new Covid-19 cases, both here and abroad, is concerning and could prove challenging for the next few months. A full economic recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to re-engage in a broad range of activities."  Powell's remarks echo comments he made earlier this month. At a virtual panel discussion at the European Central Bank's Forum on Central Banking, Powell emphasized the economy's recovery but noted that the economy that we knew before the coronavirus pandemic might be over. But recent news of promising vaccines has Powell "very positive" for the medium term, though he expects "significant challenges and uncertainties including timing, production and distribution, and efficacy across different groups." "It remains difficult to assess the timing and scope of the economic implications of these developments with any degree of confidence," he said.  Meanwhile, several programs employed by the Fed in March are set to expire at the end of the year. Powell said these programs help "unlock almost $2 trillion of funding.""These programs serve as a backstop to key credit markets and have helped restore the flow of credit from private lenders through normal channels. We have deployed these lending powers to an unprecedented extent," Powell said in his remarks. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who will testify alongside Powell this week, said in a letter on November 19 that he is granting a 90-day extension of four of those programs "in an abundance of caution." However, Mnuchin did not grant extensions for five other lending programs that include the corporate debt buying program and Main Street lending program. Powell reiterated the Fed's stance on using its policies to help lift the economic burdens onset by the pandemic, which have included keeping interest rates at zero and buying asset purchases at the current pace of $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion agency mortgage-backed securities per month.(CNN) - Days before Thanksgiving last year, President Donald Trump made an unannounced and previously unscheduled trip to Walter Reed medical center. The White House said the trip was for a "quick exam and labs." We still don't know why he actually went -- or what the outcome of his visit was.On Sunday, three days after Thanksgiving this year, President-elect Joe Biden slipped and hurt his foot while playing with his dog, Major. We were quickly told -- via the traveling press pool -- that Biden was going to see his orthopedist out of an abundance of caution. Within two hours, there was a statement from Dr. Kevin O'Connor noting that Biden's foot had been X-rayed and it appeared as though he had a sprain. A CT scan was going to be conducted just to confirm the diagnosis, however.  Then, 90 minutes after that, came this, again from O'Connor: "Initial x-rays did not show any obvious fracture, but his clinical exam warranted more detailed imaging. Follow-up CT scan confirmed hairline (small) fractures of President-elect Biden's lateral and intermediate cuneiform bones, which are in the mid-foot. It is anticipated that he will likely require a walking boot for several weeks."Notice the difference?Now, I -- and probably you -- don't know or care all that much about Joe Biden's "lateral and intermediate cuneiform bones." But that isn't really the point.The point is this: Transparency in matters of health and, well, everything else, is fundamental to a functioning democracy. And we have had the opposite of that for these last four years.Go back to Trump's unannounced and still unexplained visit to Walter Reed back in November 2019.  The initial explanation, offered by White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, for the unannounced visit was this: "Anticipating a very busy 2020, the President is taking advantage of a free weekend here in Washington, D.C., to begin portions of his routine annual physical exam at Walter Reed."Which, weird -- because the President doesn't make unscheduled visits almost anywhere, and certainly not to a hospital for tests. The White House has never offered any further explanation of the Walter Reed trip. But in a book by New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt that came out last fall, he wrote this of the incident: "In the hours leading up to Trump's trip to the hospital, word went out in the West Wing for the vice president to be on standby to take over the powers of the presidency temporarily if Trump had to undergo a procedure that would have required him to be anesthetized."Which seems an odd precaution for a "quick exam and labs," right? Right.Especially when you consider we know less about Trump's medical history than any previous candidate for president in the modern era. Trump released zero medical records when he ran for president in 2016, What he did release was a letter from Dr. Harold Bornstein, his longtime personal physician, that asserted simply: "If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency. His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary." (Bornstein later distanced himself from the letter, saying that Trump effectively dictated it to him.)Biden, who at 78 is the oldest person ever elected to a first term in the White House (he broke the record Trump set), released a summary of his medical records in late 2019. At the time, O'Connor wrote that Biden was "a healthy, vigorous, 77-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency."(Worth noting: Biden occasionally bristled when questioned about his health on the campaign trail; "If you want to check my shape, let's do push-ups together man," Biden told a man in Iowa in the fall of 2019. "Let's run, let's do whatever you want to do. Let's take an IQ test.")The transparency coming from Biden's transition team about hairline fractures in the President-elect's foot suggests that the effort by the Trump White House to actively obfuscate when asked basic questions about the President's health is over.It's a good start. But only a start. Let's see if the President-elect and his team can stay committed to full transparency about his health in the coming years.New York  (CNN Business) - When a friend reached out to Dawn Davis about the editor in chief opening at Bon Appétit, she was quick to recommend someone else — a writer she had just signed at her Simon & Schuster imprint, 37 Ink. This friend, a restaurant owner, suggested that Davis throw her name in for consideration, but the book publishing executive hesitated.   "And I thought, 'Sure,' thinking, 'Well, that's not going to work because I have no magazine experience. It's just not going to work,'" Davis told CNN Business in a phone interview earlier this month.  But not long after that conversation, Davis was subjected to a full court press. She received an email from Condé Nast's most influential leader, Anna Wintour, who complimented her work and asked if she had time to talk. Later, Davis' friend, award-winning chef Marcus Samuelsson, called her and encouraged her to apply. Samuelsson started serving as an advisor and guest editor of Bon Appétit in August — two months after then Editor-in-chief Adam Rapoport resigned over accusations of bias and for fostering a discriminatory culture at the magazine.  "Dawn thinks from 30,000 feet. You will see it through the content," Samuelsson told CNN Business. "It's going to dramatically change. It's going to be dramatically more inclusive, and that then impacts the industry and that forces our competitors to look at that space. It's needed."  The food media industry has long been accused of promoting a "White aesthetic" that props up White chefs and personalities, as Navneet Alang wrote for Eater. This summer's reckoning over racial injustice prompted many to examine and call out the complicity and bias in their own industries. Those in food media saw Rapoport, who apologized for his "failings," and Los Angeles Times food critic Peter Meehan lose their jobs over allegations of toxic or discriminatory behavior. Meehan apologized but also said that a number of the allegations against him are not true. Just before the summer, The New York Times put cooking columnist Alison Roman on leave after she criticized Marie Kondo and Chrissy Teigen, two successful women of color. Roman apologized and said she was "deeply embarrassed" about comments she made. Davis is joining Bon Appétit as somewhat of an outsider — not only because she is the magazine's first Black female editor in chief, but also because she came from the book publishing world, where she worked for 25 years. But Davis is no food neophyte. She has written and edited books about food, and as an avid home cook, she's known to be on the side of "living to eat" rather than "eating to live." Will that be enough to renew confidence — from employees, advertisers and readers — in Bon Appétit? "If you can't see it..."  After graduating from Stanford, Davis started her career on Wall Street. Her job as an analyst at an investment bank was demanding and not what Davis considered to be "soul satisfying." Despite the long hours, Davis found time to relax by taking cooking classes at the French Culinary Institute.  "Everyone was on the Harvard Business School track, and everyone was going to — and did go on — to have these uber successful jobs on Wall Street. I just had to follow this passion for learning to cook and playing in the kitchen, and I did," Davis said.  In 1989, she won a scholarship to study literature in Nigeria. Davis said she loved reading books at a young age, but she did not know that it was possible to have a career in the book industry until that flight to Nigeria where she sat next to a book publisher on the plane.  "They say, 'If you can't see it, you don't know that you can be it,'" Davis said. "I just had never met anyone who actually published books." But jumping from Wall Street to book publishing was financially risky. Davis said the career change meant cutting her salary in half. She took the leap anyway even after her friends and family questioned her decision. But she loved the job so much that at one point she thought, "When they discover how much fun I'm having, they're going to cut my salary back."  "Lived to see my memorial" Davis rose through the ranks and worked in some of the world's most famous publishing houses, including Random House, HarperCollins and Simon & Schuster. Despite being new to the field, she quickly gained confidence in her ability as an editor.  "I knew that I could be an advocate, a great advocate for any book that I was excited about," Davis said. "I never doubted that an author would have someone who was more passionate, who was going to dot more I's and cross more T's than me and just edit it to the Nth degree." In the 1990s, while working at Random House, Davis met Jonathan Karp — the publishing executive who would later recruit her to Simon & Schuster, where he would then become CEO. "We both share a deep interest in cultural works of nonfiction," Karp told CNN Business. "Dawn has great presence. I liked her the minute I met her."  He recalled that they tried to buy Eric Schlosser's "Fast Food Nation" together but didn't get it. Davis has since edited Pulitzer Prize winning books like Edward P. Jones' "The Known World" and Chris Gardner's "The Pursuit of Happyness," which was turned into a movie starring Will Smith. She is lauded for promoting Black authors and amplifying the stories of marginalized people, which became the focus of 37 Ink, her own imprint at Simon & Schuster.   "I think that a lot of people would say that she's probably the leading Black woman in the editorial world of publishing. There are other Black editors, though, and I don't want to in any way overlook them, but Dawn stands tall," Karp added.   Karp said he saw her success as "remarkable" and had hoped that she would continue the rest of her career at Simon & Schuster. But in August, Davis shared the news of her departure with her boss, colleagues and authors.   "I feel like I lived to see my memorial," Davis said. "I heard this more than once: 'It's great for you personally, and it's great for Condé Nast, and it's great for magazines. But it's a loss for book publishing.' I had been a champion of Black voices in particular and people of color in general and just quality publishing for a long time."  But editor in chief at Bon Appétit was a role she could not turn down.   "Always talking about food" Davis's early memories of food revolve around family. She recalled going to Marie Callender's in Los Angeles with her family — a weekly ritual that meant her mother and aunt could take a break from cooking. She loved Christmas Eve when her aunt would make gumbo, inviting not only family but also neighbors and friends to enjoy.  "The joy and the selflessness that my Aunt Stella gave to cooking for other people," Davis said. "I link food and community and celebration and just being together." Later, living and working in New York, Davis was exposed to a vibrant restaurant scene. She became a regular customer at Scandinavian hotspot Aquavit, where she began a lifelong friendship with executive chef, Marcus Samuelsson. "She wasn't just a regular customer," Samuelsson said. "She was like, 'Why are you doing this? What's in the food here?' She had questions around the food." Davis said her husband teases her for remembering the specific details of a meal — but not what they discussed while eating it. "I'll say, 'Oh my god, yes. You had the pork chops with the sage butter and the blistered green beans, and I had...' Meanwhile, I won't be able to remember something super, super important. It's a funny insight to the way I prioritize food."Although Bon Appétit is Davis' first job in magazines, it won't be her first experience in food journalism. She interviewed celebrity chefs including Edna Lewis and Bobby Flay for her 1999 book, "If You Can Stand the Heat: Tales from Chefs and Restaurateurs." Karp said he was not aware of Davis's love of food but "could have guessed it" since she had recently acquired a cookbook for the publishing house.  "No preconceived notions" Davis is not the only recent addition to the Bon Appétit team. In addition to Samuelsson serving as an advisor, Condé Nast hired Sonia Chopra, former director of editorial strategy for Vox Media's Eater, as executive editor. Chopra's hiring announcement came the same day as the resignation of three journalists of color from Bon Appétit's Test Kitchen videos.  Chopra said Davis, who she had not met but had heard of, was a welcomed choice.  "I think media is an industry that can be very insular," Chopra said. "Dawn — somebody who was such a leader and such a powerhouse in publishing — is coming to the industry really with clear eyes, with no preconceived notions about how a magazine should be billed or what a front of book is. I think it's going to be so refreshing." Davis has been on a listening tour at her new job, fielding questions and comments about the culture and the treatment of individuals at Condé Nast. "Some of the people I talked to were people of color who felt that they were listened to, that they were respected, that there's obviously work to be done," Davis said. "But those challenges didn't scare me away from this opportunity. Honestly, most American companies of a certain size and of a certain length of existence have this work to do."  (CNN) - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is suspending in-person lunches for GOP senators, according to his press secretary Doug Andres, ahead of the Senate's return next week. Democrats suspended their in-person lunches in the spring as a precaution because of the coronavirus pandemic. Coronavirus cases are surging across the country — and in Congress. At least 11 senators have tested positive for the virus or the antibodies since the beginning of the pandemic, including at least nine Republicans.Earlier this month, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who is 87, announced that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Grassley, as president pro tempore, is the most senior Republican in the chamber, putting him in the presidential line of succession. He is the second-oldest member of the Senate, and is just a few months younger than Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who is also 87. The oldest member of the House, Republican Rep. Don Young of Alaska, also 87, tested positive earlier this month. More than 40 members of the House of Representatives have tested positive for the virus so far, plus several incoming members. Politico first reported McConnell had suspended the gatherings. The total number of deaths in the US is up to nearly 266,000 as of Saturday evening, and a fresh wave of public health restrictions have been put in place to attempt to control the spread of the virus.Experts fear there will be even further spread of the virus throughout the country after the Thanksgiving holiday, despite warnings from public health officials not to travel or have large gatherings. Washington  (CNN) - There are roughly 10 legislative days until spending for the federal government expires, and as coronavirus cases soar around the country, the Senate returns to Washington on Monday with millions of Americans counting on Congress to also come to an agreement on a stimulus package. That's unlikely -- at this point -- to happen.The list of must-do's are long right now on Capitol Hill and this is the final stretch in the lame duck session. Aides on both the Republican and Democratic sides are confident that Congress can pass a spending deal by the December 11 deadline to avert a partial government shutdown, but a stimulus deal is far less certain. And at best, aides argue that all Congress might be able to do is add some stimulus provisions to the already-moving spending bill. Even that is a major lift.Also, on the agenda? Congress has to finish the National Defense Authorization Act, a massive, bipartisan bill that sets defense policy for the country. It's currently in limbo because of President Donald Trump's opposition to a provision that would allow the eventual renaming of military bases named after Confederate leaders. Trump has threatened to veto, and although his opposition is not new, the clock is ticking, so expect that showdown to be in the spotlight over the next two weeks.Wait, so still no breakthrough on stimulus?Yes, even as millions of Americans are finding themselves out of work during the holiday season, even as the US surpasses records in coronavirus hospitalizations, even as this pandemic is as much a part of our lives as it has ever been, Congress may not be able to provide any additional relief.As Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt told CNN's Dana Bash on "State of the Union" Sunday, "it's a huge failure on the part of the Congress."Some good news on spendingOver the weekend, appropriators continued to make progress on how to structure the 12 appropriations bills that have to be negotiated over the next two weeks. Senate Republican and House Democratic appropriators hit a milestone last week when they locked in funding levels for all 12 of those bills. Still, these massive negotiations can always go sideways as fights over the President's border wall, abortion funding language and other sticking points rear their head.What has happened to the stimulus?If you've been watching these negotiations since July, you know the sticking points. Republicans believe in a more specific approach, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell making it clear his Republican majority would be comfortable with a stimulus bill in the neighborhood of $500 billion and no more than $1 trillion. Democratic leaders, however, have made it clear that they want something closer to $2 trillion. That doesn't even begin to identify key sticking points in what both sides think should be funded. They are miles apart about enhanced unemployment benefits, liability insurance, and state and local funding. And talks over a standalone stimulus bill have ceased to exist. In the wake of the election, top administration negotiator Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has been sidelined. And the talks -- if you can even call them that -- are now occurring among leadership staff, but in the context of what could be added to a spending bill that already has to move before the end of the year.The best chance for a deal might have been before the election. Trump wanted one, Mnuchin had inched toward a $1.8 trillion package and Democrats on the front lines for reelection were urging leadership to cut a deal even if it was far from perfect. But after the election, the dynamics shifted. Trump focused his time on his legal battles across the country and Mnuchin stepped out of the talks. Since then, there has been virtually no progress on the stimulus.One thing to rememberMcConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi haven't sat down to hammer out a deal. But their staffs -- given the permission -- might be able to find some common ground. Remember, these negotiations don't exist until they do. And once things are moving, they always do have the potential to move quickly. There are areas where Republicans and Democrats agree. Both sides know that another round of the Paycheck Protection Program could inject small businesses with the kind of cash that could keep them afloat for another quarter until there is a coronavirus vaccine. Both sides know that more funding for vaccine distribution would be helpful. They realize that expanded unemployment benefits for individuals who have blown through the 26 weeks of state benefits are essential and everyone knows that schools could use more money to weather the rest of the pandemic. But someone has to sit down and negotiate. Right now, that's not really happening much at the leadership level. But watch closely over the next several days. It could change.Can't a bipartisan gang save the day here?There have been some bipartisan conversations among rank-and-file members trying to see if there is any way they could find agreement among themselves and bring some ideas to leadership. Those talks aren't far along, but include about eight to 10 members, including Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, according to aides. The talks are not formal, but it's a sign that members want to get something done before the end of the year.What expiresIt's key to remember the colossal cliff we are facing at the end of the year. When the CARES Act was written in the spring, most members weren't prepared for a pandemic that was going to be raging well after Christmas. And even those that were had hoped that there would be more legislation to ensure Americans were protected. That hasn't happened, and many programs in the CARES Act are now set to expire. Some, like a federal eviction moratorium and a pause in student loans, could be extended again through executive action. But others -- the expansion of how many weeks someone can be on unemployment, for example -- cost money and those programs would need Congress to step in.Key dates December 11: Government funding runs out at midnight.December 31: A slew of provisions from Families First Act, CARES Act and executive actions that the President signed in the fall sunset, including:     • Deferment on student loan payments     • A federal eviction moratorium (although some states have instituted their own)     • Expansion of unemployment insurance to include gig workers     • The increase in the number of weeks Americans can be on unemployment, from 26 to 39     • Mortgage forbearance for some single-family homes     • Waived penalties for individuals with hardships who borrow money out of their 401(k) early     • Expanded family and work leave for Americans dealing with the impacts of coronavirus     • The $150 billion in federal funding for state and local governments must be distributed by the end of December or the money must be returned to the fedsThat list does not include programs that have already lapsed or could be enhanced to help Americans struggling, which include:     • Another round of the Paycheck Protection Program     • Another round of stimulus checks     • Federal unemployment benefits     • Vaccine distribution moneySpeaking of money for the vaccineThis is your reminder that the CARES Act focused money for the vaccine largely on production and development, not on distribution. Now that the country is on the cusp of beginning the process of vaccinating Americans, there are serious concerns about whether there is enough funding to educate Americans and ensure they can get the vaccine when it's ready. Back in the fall, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield told Congress they'd need between $5 and $6 billion to get the job done. In conversations with the Department of Health and Human Services and congressional appropriators, the current amount of federal funding available is in the hundreds of millions. HHS has said that will be plenty, but the national association that represents health departments around the country has requested more than $8 billion from Congress to ensure they have the money they need.  Aides I've talked to have emphasized that of all the items that might be able to be added to a spending bill, vaccine distribution funding would be a high priority.Where is the President?Trump has been a little distracted lately when it comes to the spending bill, but sources close to the White House say that they are confident Trump will sign a bill to keep the government funded in a few weeks. Still, it's worth watching the fights over the border wall in the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill as well as other usual snags over abortion language that always come up. Trump tweeted over the weekend that he thought Congress should act when it came to restaurants, one of the first nods to the country's economic crisis he's given since the election."The restaurant business is being absolutely decimated. Congress should step up and help. Time is of the essence!," he said.(CNN) - With federal health officials meeting this week to make crucial decisions about who they will recommend to get the coronavirus vaccine first, pressure is mounting on Congress to step back into the governing role that they have abdicated and strike an agreement not only on the expiring aid for struggling Americans, but also the dollars needed by cash-strapped states to ensure the vaccine is equitably and effectively distributed. At a time when coronavirus cases are surging around the country, with the US hitting a new record for hospitalizations on Saturday, much attention has focused on encouraging news about the efficacy of three vaccine candidates, and Pfizer's application to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization -- with a decision expected within weeks of a December 10 meeting of a key FDA committee. But enormous logistical and readiness hurdles remain within the 50 states given their variations in geography and weather; the availability of doctors, nurses and pharmaceutical employees who must be recruited and trained to administer the vaccine; the need for vaccine education campaigns to reach skeptical Americans and even the variance in each state's level of preparedness to find and vaccinate the patients who need protection the most.  While delaying the transition, President Donald Trump hindered the ability of President-elect Joe Biden's team to get up to speed on the plans and remaining challenges of vaccine distribution. In the weeks since the election, Trump -- who has been mostly absent from public view -- has continued to falsely claim the country has turned the corner even as Covid-19 cases skyrocket, with last week's White House Thanksgiving proclamation encouraging Americans to "gather" despite the worsening pandemic.Admiral Brett Giroir, the White House's coronavirus testing czar, said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union" that the first formal meetings between the Biden team and the officials handling vaccine logistics through the federal government's Operation Warp Speed went "extremely well" and predicted a "smooth, professional transition." He described the current Covid-19 distribution plan as "pretty optimum," noting that the government has already distributed 180 million flu vaccines this year -- and will be starting with about 40 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine. "Now the logistics are more difficult and the cold chain is more difficult, but I really am confident in the plan to get it, and particularly get it to the states and get it to the high risk populations," Giroir told CNN's Dana Bash. But warring political parties in Congress, distracted by a presidential election that Trump has baselessly contested, have been unable to come to any sort of agreement about the size and the scope of the next emergency funding package related to Covid-19. The pressure should be on when lawmakers return to Washington this week. But they'll also have to move quickly to pass a spending package to avert a partial government shutdown by December 11, which could once again distract from the need for Covid-19 relief.Members went on Thanksgiving recess amid dimming hopes of a deal even though millions of Americans are facing a December 26 cutoff of their emergency unemployment benefits and other financial protections that have helped guard against economic devastation as a result of the virus.Congress' inability to act has left not only those jobless workers facing an end-of-the-year financial crash, but also many state officials worried about whether they will have the resources to train workers and effectively distribute a vaccine — from tracking and corralling patients back to get the second shot, as some of the vaccines require; to being able to procure enough dry ice and enhanced storage capabilities to keep it at the right temperatures once it is delivered. (Pfizer's Covid vaccine must be kept between about negative 60 and negative 80 degrees Celsius).States need more moneyThe Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, in concert with the Association of Immunization Managers — whose members will handle many of the intermediary steps between the federal government's delivery of the vaccine and the point where it is injected in a patient's arm — told Congressional leaders last month that they will need $8.4 billion in the next coronavirus emergency aid package to handle some of those challenges. In mid-October, the National Governors Association submitted a list of questions on behalf of both Democratic and Republican governors to the Trump administration detailing their unsettled queries about vaccine funding, allocation and supply chain requirements. The memo noted that "without additional state and local funding to implement COVID-19 vaccine plans, we will be hampered in what we can accomplish."The federal government has provided $200 million to states for vaccine preparedness through the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And the Department of Health and Human Services told the National Governors Association that the next tranche of Covid vaccine readiness funding would be awarded by mid-December: $140 million to "expand this readiness work and fill initial gaps." In that memo, HHS officials underscored that "most of the major costs of a vaccine campaign are already being covered," including the costs of the securing the vaccines themselves and "almost all transportation," as well as insurance reimbursements for providers and a federal fund that will cover the costs of vaccinating the uninsured. But in response to governors' questions about whether there will be more funding to make sure they have enough "boots on the ground" to conduct the vaccinations, the department acknowledged that "existing clinical infrastructure will be heavily relied upon." Some of the biggest ticket items included in the $8.4 billion request from the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials and the Association of Immunization Managers was $3 billion for workforce recruitment and training, $1.2 billion for cold supply chain management, $500 million for the modernization of the data capabilities for Immunization Information Systems, and $1 billion for the creation of additional vaccination sites that can accommodate safe social distancing as people line up to get the vaccine, as well as protection for health workers from the elements at outdoor sites. The Washington Post reported this week that a health official in Maine is considering vaccination sites like heated fire stations and car washes to keep their health workers from having to conduct vaccinations in full personal protective gear out in the cold. In September, Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC, told members of a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that states and jurisdictions would need between $5.5 and $6 billion to distribute and safely monitor the vaccine. At the time, Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican, told Redfield that if the US were to have the vaccine but lacked either the plan or resources to distribute it, that would be a "huge failure on the part of the Congress to provide the resources that we know are going to be necessary." Blunt told Bash on Sunday that he hoped Congress could come to an agreement to provide funding to states, to stabilize the economy through additional aid to small businesses and "direct money to struggling families" and extend unemployment benefits, but he said he was not certain a deal could be reached. "I've been one of the major advocates that we need to do this -- we need to do this now," Blunt said. "We need to continue the funding for the vaccine, and the delivery of the vaccine." But the Missouri Republican blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders for refusing to accept a smaller, more targeted package that was less than $2 trillion. "The problem was that our friends on the other side of the building (in the US House) thought that it was $2.4 trillion or nothing. Half of that would have made a big difference, and then after the first of the year we could have dealt with this again," Blunt said. "I think it's a huge failure on the part of the Congress and I'm disappointed by it. The President was prepared to sign almost any size bill. I think they didn't want to give him that win before the election and now we can't seem to figure out how to give it to him after the election." This past week, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo highlighted the precarious financial predicament that states are facing with their coffers drained from expanding testing, tracing and other Covid-19-related costs this year. "The current vaccine program that's on the table is going to have to be improved," Cuomo said during a news conference. "The states are broke because Washington never approved state and local funding."When California Gov. Gavin Newsom outlined his state's vaccine distribution plans last week — including the state's continuing search for adequate storage units, an ample supply of dry ice, its efforts to obtain ultra low temperature freezers and "mini freezers" for smaller counties — he said the federal government needs to step up with much more financial support.The difference in state capabilities and resources could also create major equity issues that Congress might need to help negate with additional funding. State officials have expressed concerns to CNN that they do not yet know exactly when they will receive the vaccine or how much. And some are grappling with how to get the vaccine to rural populations without wasting precious doses if they must meet minimum order requirements from the vaccine manufacturers and discard unused vials after a limited amount of time.  A key panel considers which groups will get the vaccine firstThe CDC's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) has called an emergency meeting Tuesday so they can vote on recommendations for the first people to get a coronavirus vaccine, once one gets emergency authorization from the FDA.While most agree that front-line health workers should be first in line, there are ongoing discussions about whether residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities should also be included in the first round. Dr. Celine Gounder, a member of Biden's coronavirus advisory board, said Saturday that "people who are doing things that we really can't function without" should receive the vaccine first. "Doctors, nurses who are caring for patients in the hospital, including patients with coronavirus, should very much be among those first receiving the vaccine," Gounder told CNN's Boris Sanchez. "Beyond that, there are other front-line workers, essential workers -- whether that's the people who are working in food and meat processing (or) people who are at the grocery store checkout counter."This story has been updated with additional developments. (CNN) - Chadwick Boseman would have turned 44 on November 29 and Disney honored him in a way that was fit for a Marvel king.Boseman, who died in August after a private battle with colon cancer, starred as T'Challa/Black Panther in the Marvel superhero franchise.On Saturday, Disney chairman Bob Iger tweeted to alert that something was coming."To all fans of #BlackPanther: watch the film on #DisneyPlus late tonight, for a special tribute to someone that was and will always be near and dear to our hearts," the tweet read.That turned out to be a new opening credit for the "Black Panther" film currently streaming on Disney+.The slightly more than 30 second tribute shows clips of Boseman and was shared by Marvel Studios' official Twitter account.No announcement has been made as of yet for how the studio plans to handle casting for "Black Panther 2," which is scheduled to begin filming in 2021. (CNN) - Breaking from his regular post-election schedule of tweeting and playing golf, President Donald Trump took time Sunday morning to call into Maria Bartiromo's show on Fox Business to rehash many of the warmed-over conspiracy theories -- happy post-Thanksgiving! -- he has touted about why he lost the 2020 race to President-elect Joe Biden.Bartiromo, who was once a serious and credible journalist, offered little in the way of, you know, facts to dispute Trump's entirely false and disproven claims. Which, in turn, allowed the President to make more and more outlandish claims. (Note: He did not claim that he had invented the question mark.)I went through the transcript of the "interview." The lines you need to see are below.1. "You have leaders of countries that call me, say, that's the most messed-up election we have ever seen."Really? Leaders of foreign countries are calling Trump and saying that the 2020 election is "the most messed-up" one that they have seen? Who, you ask? Oh, Trump didn't name any names. And away we go!2. "They had glitches. You know what a glitch is. That's -- a glitch is supposed to be when a machine breaks down.""We fixed the glitch." -- The Bobs3. "We had glitches where they moved thousands of votes from my account to Biden's account. And these are glitches. So, they're not glitches. They're theft. They're fraud, absolute fraud."NOPE!4. "I think we caught four or five glitches of about 5,000 votes each, and different states. And, again, they're not glitches."False.5.  "And what happened, if you watched the election, I was called by the biggest people, saying, congratulations, political people. Congratulations, sir. You just won the election. It was 10:00."The "biggest people" called at 10 p.m. EST to congratulate Trump on winning a second term? These "biggest people" must be unaware of how elections work.6. "And then they did dumps. They call them dumps, big, massive dumps, in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and all over.""Dumps" are rightly understood as areas with large populations -- mostly in cities -- reporting their votes.7. "And they did these massive dumps of votes. And all of a sudden, I went from winning by a lot to losing by a little."Stay with me on this: In cities where lots of people live and where Trump is not popular, he lost by large margins. Those large margins for Biden helped offset Trump's wins in rural, less populated areas in these swing states. Which is how elections, um, work.8. "I said, well, I hear bad things about the machines. I hear bad things about corruption."[nods head knowingly ... looks around to see if anyone else is nodding]9. "But even worse, dead people were applying to get a ballot. They were making application to get ballots, many. And, you know, we're not talking about 10 people. We're talking -- there are a lot of dead people that so-called voted in this election."Nah, bro. 10. "And how the FBI and Department of Justice -- I don't know. Maybe they are involved. But how people are allowed to get away from this stuff -- with this stuff is unbelievable."OK, wait. So, the FBI and the Department of Justice -- run by Trump loyalist Bill Barr -- may well be in on this plot to steal the election from Trump? This thing goes deeper than any of us thought!11. "I mean, you're doing something. You're actually very brave, because you're doing something.""Brave" is not the word I would have chosen for Bartiromo's role in this interview ... 12. "This is the greatest fraud in the history of our country, from an electoral standpoint. And I guess you could build it up bigger than an electoral stand -- what's bigger from an electoral standpoint? What is bigger than this?"Even when it comes to false claims of fraud, Trump has to be No. 1.13. "Joe Biden did not get 80 million votes. Now, we were -- we were planning -- we -- I got 63 million votes four years ago and won quite handily in the Electoral College, won quite handily. We did very well. I got 63." Biden didn't get 80 million votes ... he got 80,259,147 -- and counting.14. "I'm telling you, at 10:00, everybody thought it was over."[narrator voice] They didn't.15. "We are trying. We have so much evidence.""Trump Lawyer to Pennsylvania Judge: Nope, I've Got No Evidence of Voter Fraud"16. "You know, the poll watchers -- and this is true with all of the states, just about, that you're talking about, I think all of them. They weren't allowed to have poll watchers."NOPE!17. "And from what everybody is saying, and from what -- I don't think we even have to prove this.""I don't think we even have to prove this" -- the President of the United States, claiming widespread voter fraud and a rigged election.18. "They say that I was doing so much better than they thought that they panicked, and they started just doing ballot after ballot very quickly and just checking the Biden name on top. They didn't have time.""They."19. "I would like to file one nice, big, beautiful lawsuit, talking about this and many other things, with tremendous proof.""Big, Beautiful Lawsuit" was the name of my high school band. We were extremely litigious.20. "And they had electoral officials making deals, like this character in Georgia, who is a disaster. And the governor's done nothing. He's done absolutely nothing. I'm ashamed that I endorsed him."In which Trump attacks the Republican secretary of state and Republican governor of Georgia because, uh, they won't say he actually carried the state? Or something? Also, here's Trump on Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp two weeks before the November election: "Brian Kemp, and he's a really smart guy, a really good guy and I endorse him and he went on to win and his wonderful wife, Marty, is even better than him." So, yeah.21. "Joe Biden did not get 16 million more votes than Barack Hussein Obama. He didn't get it."Trump's proof for this claim? Are you new here? None! Also, the not-even-a-dog-whistle of "Hussein" thrown in for good measure!22. "There are so many different things."So true.23. "They watch the votes being counted. It's so important. It is, like, the most important. Otherwise, people will cheat, unfortunately."This is the President of the United States. Speaking about poll watching. Which is "like, the most important."24. "Everyone knows that the poll watchers were thrown out of buildings."Still no!25. "When they are voting for dead people, and when dead people are signing applications, meaning they're not, meaning somebody else is fraudulently signing, I mean, in the name of a dead person, well, that tells you a lot."Not true! Still! 26. "Well, how come there are thousands of dead people voting?"[narrator voice] There weren't.27. "Missing in action. Can't tell you where they are. I ask, are they looking at it? Everyone says, yes, they're looking at it."This is Trump on his own Department of Justice. Which has, largely, done his bidding since Barr was appointed as attorney general. Of course, nothing is ever enough for Trump. Ever.28. "And what happened to Durham? Where's Durham?""Where's Wallace at?"29." And I know FBI.""I know FBI." -- the President of the United States.30. "You would think, if you're in the FBI or Department of Justice, this is -- this is the biggest thing you could be looking at. Where are they? I have not seen anything. I mean, I just -- they just keep moving along, and they go on to the next president."Again, Bill Barr, the head of the Department of Justice, was appointed by Donald Trump.31. "But many ballots -- many ballots with the name Trump on were thrown out. You have read that. They found ballots in a river with the name Trump on from the military. They were signed. And they were floating in a river."Trump has seized on this story as evidence of widespread voter fraud. The incident, which happened in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, involved a total of nine ballots. And local officials determined it was an error made by a "temporary seasonal independent contractor."32. "It was a Russia, Russia hoax. It was just pure hoax. It was a pure hoax and a very -- a very sad thing for the country.""Over the course of my career I have seen a number of challenges to our democracy. The Russian government's effort to interfere in our election is among the most serious." -- Special Counsel Robert Mueller33. "If I wasn't here, Antifa would be running this country right now. They'd be running the country."Uh, what?34. "And if I'm not here -- I'm sort of your wall. You know, we're completing the wall, like I said I would. Everyone said, you would never be able to do it."So, the wall was Trump all along? This was all a huge metaphor? World rocked.35. "We could have a great case. We do have a great case. We have the greatest case ever.""The greatest case ever."36. "I came up with vaccines that people didn't think we'd have for five years. And we have them."Trump came up with the Covid-19 vaccines? I had not heard that!37. "We're doing better than the rest of the world. We're doing better."As of Monday morning, the US had more than 13 million confirmed cases of coronavirus and nearly 267,000 deaths from the virus. Both are the most in the world.38. "But actually, I watched -- I watched a few of the shows last night. I got to see a couple of them."All he does is watch TV.39. "Sean Hannity, he knows. He gets it. He gets it."Uh huh.40. "In other words, my mind will not change in six months. There was tremendous cheating here."In other other words: He's never conceding. This feels like a good place to end.(CNN) - Top health officials on Sunday called on Americans to get tested for coronavirus after Thanksgiving travel as an important measure to help mitigate the virus' spread amid a surge in US cases. But when it came to whether individuals should quarantine or isolate, and for how long, responses from the nation's leading experts differed. Assistant Secretary for Health Adm. Brett Giroir told CNN's Dana Bash on "State of the Union" that it is "not recommended to have a quarantine after travel unless you've had a direct exposure to a person with Covid for 15 minutes in close contact."But Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, went a step further, encouraging individuals returning from travel to quarantine, if possible, to mitigate the spread. "Right now, as people go back we want to urge them, if they've been in situations outside of the family setting in which they really don't know the level of exposure, to be really careful when you either return from the place that you went or other people come back into your house," Fauci told Martha Raddatz on ABC's "This Week." "That you really gotta understand the importance of trying to prevent further spread and further surge. That may be, when you go back to where you've came from, if it's possible to quarantine yourself for a period of time or even get tested to make sure that you are not bringing infection back to another place, be it another home or another family."And US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said those who gathered for Thanksgiving can still isolate and get tested."For those who did travel and those who did attend large gatherings, we want you to know it's not too late to take measures to slow the spread of this virus," Adams said during an interview on "Fox News Sunday." "You can still isolate, you can still get tested in three to five days, you can still take measures that have been proven to help us prevent cases, hospitalizations and deaths."White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx agreed that families who gathered for Thanksgiving should get tested for the virus, and people over age 65 should get tested immediately if they develop any symptoms. "If you're young and you gathered, you need to be tested about five to 10 days later," Birx told Margaret Brennan Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation." "You need to assume that you're infected and not go near your grandparents and aunts and others without a mask."CDC recommendationsThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that a person quarantine after being in close contact, or "6 feet of someone who has COVID-19 for a total of 15 minutes or more." The CDC also recommends Americans take precautions such as mask wearing inside the home, hand washing, and social distancing "regardless of where you traveled or what you did during your trip" to protect others from getting the virus. The agency also advises Americans to follow guidelines in states that require travelers to quarantine or get tested.Giroir on Sunday said Americans who traveled during the Thanksgiving holiday are at an increased risk of contracting the virus, meaning they should get tested, wear masks and avoid big groups."Make really sure you adhere 100% to mask wearing to avoid crowds because you could inadvertently have gotten Covid and spread it, so just be careful during the week after your travel because you are at increased risk," Giroir told Bash. "Just remember you've had an increased risk of being exposed, so you should decrease unnecessary activities for about a week, and if you can get tested in three or five days that's also a very good idea."The guidance following Thanksgiving comes after health experts warned Americans about traveling to see family and to avoid large gatherings during the holidays as the number of coronavirus cases surges across the US. More than 91,000 Americans were hospitalized with the virus on Saturday, the highest daily number yet in hospitalizations due to the virus. On Wednesday, 1,070,967 people passed through security at US airports nationwide, the highest level since mid-March, Transportation Security Administration spokeswoman Lisa Farbstein said Thursday. 'We are at a risky time'Giroir said Sunday he is concerned about a possible surge in cases and hospitalizations as holiday travel increases."There certainly can be a surge because of the travel and the mixing of people who have not been in their own little pods," he said. "We are at a risky time because of the travel and again, it's not just the travel, but it's exposing people who have not been sort of in their own pods."On a separate program, Fauci said Sunday that he was also concerned about hospitalizations. He said people not adhering to earlier guidance from the CDC and other health experts about avoiding Thanksgiving gatherings could lead to another surge in cases."But, you know people are not always going to do that so what we expect unfortunately, as we go to the next couple of weeks into December, that we might see a surge superimposed upon that surge that we're already in," Fauci said during an interview on NBC's "Meet The Press." He also said "it is not too late at all for us to do something about this" and for Americans to "be careful" when traveling back home.Trump painted a far rosier picture of the virus in the US in his first television interview since the election. "We're doing better than the rest of the world," Trump told Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo on Sunday, despite the high number of infections the US is experiencing. Editor's Note: Miguel Cervantes del Toro is entering his seventh year as principal of Callaway Elementary School in Baltimore City Public Schools. He is an alum of New Leaders, a non-profit organization that provides equity-focused school leadership training and mentorship. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.(CNN) - The outside of the northwest Baltimore elementary school where I have been principal for seven years is covered in a brightly colored, student-designed mural featuring portraits of our children and their families reading together. Our community can, quite literally, see themselves reflected in this artwork. The mural was part of a schoolwide project about brain science, literacy and art, all hallmarks of our school's curriculum.           Most of my students -- nearly all of whom come from low-income families severely impacted by this pandemic -- haven't been inside our school since March. The uncertainty and emotional toil of this crisis, on top of the trauma my students have already experienced from living in one of the most violent neighborhoods in the city, is heartbreaking. Our school is an anchor for our students, a place where they know they belong, no matter what is going on at home or on their block.Put simply: I am worried about losing an entire generation of students to this pandemic. That's why I hope the next US Secretary of Education truly sees public education as the great equalizer for students like mine -- children beating the odds, growing up in a neighborhood with limited access to fresh produce, on the edge of the Callaway-Garrison neighborhood that was redlined in the 1930s, nearly four  miles from where Freddie Gray, a Black man whose death while in police custody sparked protests, lived. I want the next education secretary to understand and acknowledge the myriad impacts of long-standing systemic racism. Moreover, I want the next education secretary to have an aggressive plan to address those injustices and dismantle racist systems for all students in real, tangible ways.Like our mural, the next education secretary and his or her team must reflect the diversity of public schools. Even as the demographics of public school students have shifted to be majority children of color, the nation's top education leaders have been mostly White. My students need federal leaders who understand the barriers -- some seen and some not -- that Black and Latinx students face every day in this country. They need to see themselves represented in the diversity of leadership at every level: teachers, principals, state and national education departments. The education secretary must know that the odds stacked against my students were put there on purpose by generations of White supremacy, and that my school is the place that will give them wings to soar in life.I live for the day when an education secretary visits my school and engages in a deep discussion with us about good instruction and what yields the best results for our students. When I tell the next education secretary that my school saw the biggest gains in English in our district in 2018, I want him or her to know what a big deal that is for my student population and to talk in depth with us about how we did it. I want the next person who fills this position to know that I am an immigrant who moved with my family from Mexico to Sacramento, California, when I was 11, and that I became a teacher because I saw the difference that education made in my life. I experienced firsthand the vast inequities that exist in public school systems as an immigrant and English language learner. I took part in leadership development programs like New Leaders because I knew that kind of training -- coupled with the doctorate that I'm working on right now -- would put me on the path to being the most effective school principal and advocate for even more students in my adopted home of Baltimore. This year has been incredibly difficult for schools as we watched the very foundation of public education -- seeing students walk in the door every day -- disappear before our eyes. The teachers at my school are working hard to keep our students engaged in learning virtually. This month, a small group of special education and kindergarten students returned to in-person learning in our school building with extra help from service providers like speech and occupational therapists. However, like many districts across the country, we do not know how long this will last.For our remote learners, we extended our school day by an hour so teachers can give one-on-one support to students. We handed out 250 laptops and 40 hotspots -- most provided by the district and a few others donated by community organizations -- to ensure all of our 320 students could stay connected to school. I consider this a small miracle considering 17 million children across the country live in homes without internet access, and no level of government has addressed that crisis in any real way. Not only has the federal government not allocated any relief funding to closing the digital divide for students during this pandemic, but Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, citing "economic turmoil" resulting from Covid-19, recently vetoed bills that would have provided much needed resources for schools like mine. We need the next education secretary to act with urgency to ensure that we do not lose any more ground with students. We need resources to help schools safely reopen again and we need funding for mental health support to address the trauma the pandemic has caused. My school recently received a state grant to hire a full-time social worker, which has been critical to our students in this time of learning at home. But what happens when that grant runs out? Teaching children doesn't stop with their brains. We must develop the whole child to ensure students are ready mentally, physically, emotionally and academically for success in life.The next education secretary must understand that the stakes are high for my students. Once students leave my school after fifth grade, they take tests to get into the best middle schools in Baltimore. Where they get placed determines their academic trajectory all the way into college. The next education secretary must act boldly to provide all children with access to high-quality education no matter where they live. What's more, he or she must be student-centered in every action taken and every decision made.   The next US Secretary of Education can make the biggest impact on public education in a generation -- but the education secretary must act with urgency. Our students cannot wait any longer.(CNN) - The coronavirus pandemic forced celebrities to adapt to a brave new world away from their adorning fans, and they responded in myriad ways.

"Years ago, I bought a thing called a Flowbee. It comes with a vacuum cleaner and clippers. I still have it."A Flowbee is a device invented in the 1980s that can be placed on the end of a vacuum cleaner to trim hair."My hair's like straw, so it's easy to cut," Clooney explained, before imitating the noise the machine makes as it hoovers up his million-dollar locks. "Listen man, it works," he said.Earlier this month the actor revealed that he once gave away $14 million in cash to his closest friends while working on the hit film "Gravity."He shared the anecdote in an interview with GQ, which crowned Clooney its Icon of the Year, among other honorees like Megan Thee Stallion and Trevor Noah.Washington  (CNN) - An attorney for the Trump campaign on Monday issued a call for violence against Chris Krebs, a former cybersecurity official who was unceremoniously ousted from his post by President Donald Trump after he rejected the President's unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud.  Joe diGenova, an attorney for Trump's campaign, said during an appearance on "The Howie Carr Show": "Anybody who thinks the election went well, like that idiot Krebs who used to be the head of cybersecurity. That guy is a class A moron. He should be drawn and quartered. Taken out at dawn and shot."A source familiar with Trump's election challenges said diGenova is believed to still be helping Rudy Giuliani, Trump's attorney, in challenging the presidential election results. CNN has reached out to the White House and the Trump campaign for comment. DiGenova and Carr did not immediately response to requests for comment.The remarks from diGenova, though much more extreme than others made by officials in the White House during Trump's time in office, underscore the administration's crusade against whistleblowers and others who have spoken out in opposition during the President's term and refuse to adopt his conspiratorial view of the election.DiGenova's remarks were swiftly condemned on Monday by the Government Accountability Project, a whistleblower group that warned that such threats could have a chilling effect on officials seeking to expose wrongdoing. "Threats like these trigger an avalanche of them. They terrorize other whistleblowers into silence. It's behavior befitting a mob attorney," Louis Clark, the group's executive director and chief executive officer, said in a blistering statement on Monday. Trump announced earlier in November that Krebs would be "terminated" from his job running the cyber arm of the Department of Homeland Security "effective immediately" because Krebs' recent statement -- in which he had rejected Trump's claims of widespread voter fraud -- was "highly inaccurate." CNN reported ahead of Krebs' firing that he had expected the move.The statement from Krebs' agency, along with state and private election officials, had read: "The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history. ... There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised."In the lead-up to the election, Krebs had often quietly disputed the President's repeated false claims about mail-in ballots but went out of his way to not get drawn into criticizing his boss for spreading lies.But in the days that followed, Krebs had adopted a more forceful approach, regularly posting on Twitter -- often with blaring red siren emojis -- fact checks of the claims and conspiracy theories being pushed by Trump, his allies and supporters around the country.Despite states certifying their results and awarding electoral votes to President-elect Joe Biden ahead of the Electoral College meeting on December 14, Trump has not conceded the election. Instead, he has continued to falsely claim that he won.(CNN) - President-elect Joe Biden enters the month of December with a question still looming over one of the most critical decisions in his Cabinet: Who will he nominate to be Secretary of Defense? Three candidates are in final contention to lead the Pentagon, people familiar with the matter told CNN, as Michele Flournoy, Jeh Johnson and Lloyd Austin are all still being considered. But Biden's delay in naming a nominee is giving space and time for critics to air their complaints -- and the corporate connections of all three candidates are giving progressive Democrats grounds to object. The pick is an important one, as it represents Biden's first commander in chief decision in the new "post-war" era President Donald Trump leaves behind. As a result, the candidates for defense secretary are facing increased scrutiny over whether they have the political chops to cut defense spending, as some in Congress want, while still funding innovative future technology and prioritizing the challenges posed by Russia and China -- all while maintaining military deterrence against Iran, North Korea, and ISIS.  Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat and decorated combat veteran, is no longer getting a serious look, people familiar with the matter said, given Biden's reluctance to create any vacancies in the Senate.Flournoy, a veteran Pentagon official, was once widely considered a lock for the position and is still very much in the mix, people familiar with the matter told CNN, but her exclusion from a flurry of barrier-breaking selections in Biden's first wave of Cabinet picks underscored an increasing uncertainty surrounding her candidacy. Some progressive groups have mobilized in recent days to oppose Flournoy's nomination, though the delay may also be due to the complicated puzzle Biden is assembling as he tries to fulfill his promise of building a Cabinet that reflects the diversity of America -- a potential factor in the President-elect's delay in naming a CIA director as well. Critics have raised concerns about Flournoy's potential conflicts of interest, questioning how her support for former President Barack Obama's troop surge in Afghanistan and the continued sale of arms to Saudi Arabia aligns with the business interests of Booz Allen Hamilton, a Pentagon contractor where she served on the board of directors. They have also pointed to Flournoy's role as co-founder of WestExec Advisers, whose primary business is helping US companies with global footprints navigate geopolitical risk, as a concern. Flounroy founded the consulting firm with Biden's pick for secretary of state, Antony Blinken."In Flournoy's case, the seeming alignment between the interests of her clientele and her stated policy positions -- such as her desire to continue selling arms to Saudi Arabia as late as 2019, which is out of step with Biden and essentially all congressional Democrats, is especially worrisome," David Segal, co-founder and executive director of the group Demand Progress, told CNN.A spokesperson for Flournoy pushed back on that assertion, telling CNN, "Michele's private sector experiences do not influence her policy views or work." The spokesperson also noted that Flournoy "has no involvement in contracting or business development with any client, including the US government" as a member of Booz Allen's board of directors.  A WestExec spokesperson told CNN that the firm undertakes "an intensive client vetting process to ensure that the companies with which we work and the nature of the work we do for them meet our strict ethical standards." Candidates face scrutiny over ties to defense contractorsWhile serving on the board of a defense contractor is considered a conflict and typically requires a cooling off period before anyone can be nominated as defense secretary, others in the position have had similar backgrounds. Other candidates Biden is considering for the post also have ties to defense contractors.Johnson is on the board of directors for defense giant Lockheed Martin Corp., while Austin is on the board of directors for another weapons contractor, Raytheon Technologies. Johnson served as general counsel at the Pentagon, as well as secretary of Homeland Security. Austin, a retired Army general who led Central Command during the Obama era, would need a congressional waiver to be confirmed for the civilian post because he retired from active-duty service only four years ago. Johnson and Austin, who are African American, would be history making nominees as the first Black secretary of defense. So, too, would Flournoy, as the first woman to run the Pentagon. Those factors, the criticism and the importance of the post create a fine-tuned political challenge for Biden involving Congress and allies -- making their views on the nominee important to take into consideration. Some Democrats on the Senate and House Armed Services Committee have voiced public support for Flournoy in recent days."Michele Flournoy has a deep understanding of the existing DOD bureaucracy and the future of our defense. That's a rare combination. I would love to see her nominated for Secretary of Defense," Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat who served in the Marines and is on the House Armed Services Committee, wrote in a tweet last week.A Democratic Senate aide told CNN last week that senior members of the panel also believe Flournoy would be a good choice but said there has been little direct contact with the Biden transition and lawmakers remain mostly in the dark as to who the President-elect will ultimately nominate. In a letter to Biden earlier this month that did not name Flournoy, but was widely viewed as pushback on her potential nomination, Democratic Reps. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin and Barbara Lee of California, two leading House progressives, requested "that the next Secretary of Defense have no prior employment history with a defense contractor."For her part, Flournoy sought to address some of those concerns in a recent call with progressive foreign policy groups, two sources -- including one on the line for the discussion -- told CNN. "She is interested in understanding the views of progressive groups, and that's why she has met with them. To hear, firsthand, their perspective. And to clarify any misperceptions that exist about her positions," said another source familiar with the conversation and Flournoy's view of the situation."I expect that if she is nominated that these conversations will continue," the source added.A source familiar with Flournoy's thinking told CNN that her interest in serving on the board of private companies is, in part, to learn. "How can you hold industry accountable and conduct good oversight of acquisition if you don't understand it?" they said. Asked if Flournoy will reveal her clients if nominated for the defense secretary job, her spokesperson said: "As always, Ms. Flournoy will fully comply with the law and any disclosure requirements."The announcement about the Pentagon's next leader is still expected soon -- perhaps later this week or next -- but the exact timing is contingent on a final decision that as of late Sunday evening had not been reached, people familiar with the matter said. Biden weighs options for CIA directorThe Defense Department opening is not happening in a vacuum. Biden is also still searching for someone to lead the Central Intelligence Agency -- and Johnson is also believed to be at least under consideration for that post, people familiar with the matter said. Former CIA Acting Director Mike Morell also remains a contender, as CNN has previously reported, but his status as a frontrunner has been tested with a barrage of attacks from Senate Intelligence Committee Democrat Ron Wyden, who has accused him of being a "torture apologist."Since Wyden's attacks, senior transition officials have spoken with other Democratic senators, including members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to discuss possible candidates to lead CIA. In addition to Morell, Sue Gordon, a former principal deputy Director of National Intelligence, is also a contender, people familiar with the matter told CNN, as is Vincent Stewart, a former leader of the Defense Intelligence Agency and Marine general. He, too, would require a congressional waiver to serve in the civilian post. The Intelligence Committee is the first gauntlet on the path to confirmation and Gordon "would be very popular if nominated," one of the aides told CNN, suggesting she may have an easier time being confirmed than Morell if he starts taking more fire from progressives."I would always serve my country," Gordon told CNN on Monday. "If asked I would serve."Former senior Obama adviser Lisa Monaco and former CIA deputy director David Cohen are also in the running, multiple sources familiar with the discussions say.Tom Donilon, a former national security adviser to Obama who had been among the top contenders to lead the CIA, is no longer under consideration for that post, CNN reported Sunday.A transition official said the announcements for Pentagon and CIA would be made when Biden reaches his decisions, dismissing any suggestions of a delay. Nominations for both posts, in addition to others in the Cabinet, are expected in December. (CNN) - Other: A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter.

Yet President Donald Trump is in a state of suspended animation, pushing conspiracy theories about his loss as the world moves on without him.The question for all Americans to consider is how long we must continue to pay attention to this man.The long-term answer will depend very much on how long he continues to be the single mobilizing force for Republican voters. And, very long-term, there's not a lot of evidence that one-termers leave lasting impressions. Given the horrible silence among other top Republicans (Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, notably) when it comes to affirming Biden's electoral victory, it could be a while. But let's talk when Trump's six months out of office.The short-term answer is very different. Trump seems busy with tweeting, golfing and pushing fantasy fiction that he didn't lose the election. But the machinery of his government continues to move around him.Diluting the power of undocumented immigrants. His lawyers were arguing before the US Supreme Court that he should be able to exclude undocumented immigrants from the Census count, a decision that runs counter to the language in the Constitution, but is a variation on the efforts to crack down on immigrants at a time when the GOP's political base appears to be shrinking. Even conservative Supreme Court justices were skeptical during arguments Monday, and it appeared they could punt. Read more.Making it harder to become a citizen. The civics portion of the US Citizenship test is being updated from 100 questions to 128 beginning on December 1. See sample questions here.Speeding up executions. The Justice Department will seek to speed up the death penalty for a handful of people on federal death row before January 20 and move forward with a new rule that opens the gate to potential firing squads. If these executions take place, it'll be the most during a presidential transition since 1884, according to the Death Penalty Information Project. It's a practice Trump revitalized and one that Biden would abolish. Read more.Building the wall -- Most of the more than 400 miles that have been constructed during the Trump administration replace sections where previous barriers were falling down or outdated. But even with just 25 miles of new construction, according to the New York Times, the black line of wall that snakes along portions of the Southern border will be a legacy. And they describe a push to get as much done by January 20 as possible, although it's not clear exactly when or how Biden will move to halt construction. And it's very unlikely he'll be tearing any down. Read more. Changing a host of rules. ProPublica has an excellent review of rules the administration is pushing through its executive authority. They would curb, for now, immigration and make it more difficult for the EPA to impose pollution restrictions, as well as allow the Department of Energy to roll back standards for washing machines, and others, and open up more federal land to oil and gas exploration just before Biden tries to move the country toward cleaner energy.All of these things will take time for Biden and his team to unwind, if they decide to do so.Over on Capitol Hill, things are coming to a head. A Covid-19 stimulus proposal for more aid and a new round of stimulus checks is in limbo, perhaps until Biden takes office, but Trump's signature will be needed on a massive government spending bill to keep the government running. He's said before he dislikes these bills.Related: Don't expect a second stimulus check this yearTrump also dislikes the bipartisan defense authorization bill, which sets policy for the Pentagon, because it opens the door to renaming US military bases currently named for confederate generals -- Ft. Hood, for instance.But there's a LOT for this Congress to get through and not much time left to do it. Read more.: Georgia means everything for Biden's presidencyWhat the next president can accomplish will have everything to do with the twin Senate races in Georgia. It's hard to overstate how important a Senate majority would be to Biden's plans -- or even filling his Cabinet with who he wants.All of these things could go one way if McConnell's in charge of the Senate and a very different way if it's Chuck Schumer:Cabinet. For instance, there are rumblings that his preferred Office of Management and Budget Director, the liberal think tank leader Neera Tanden, could face a GOP blockade. She's been on the record criticizing Republicans for years, and if Republicans run the Senate, she'll need at least a few Republicans to support her. Read more.Undoing Trump rules. Addressing last minute Trump administration rules will be much easier if it can be done by Congress. It'll be more time consuming to do things administratively.Fixing Obamacare. If the Supreme Court invalidates the Affordable Care Act (or even if he doesn't) what Biden can do about health care depends very much on who controls the Senate.Addressing the Covid economy. What stimulus proposal Biden can entertain will look very different coming out of a Senate where Democrats control the chamber compared to one where McConnell decides what gets a vote.Building back better. The aforementioned items are relatively small bore when put up against the climate crisis and how or even whether to do anything. GOP orthodoxy right now is that climate change is not something that should be addressed by government. Democrats side with scientists that think it's an existential threat.Biden wants to rewire the entire US economy around clean energy. He might not be able to do much with the filibuster in place, but he can obviously do more with a more friendly majority.: The GOP rift on elections is something to watch in GeorgiaRepublicans need to win those Senate seats as much as Democrats do if they want to block Biden's plans, which makes it all the more telling that Trump and his campaign continue to try to get the presidential results overturned rather than focusing on getting out the vote for the Senate races. Trump's campaign again tried to get Republican officials in Georgia to undermine the results by questioning mail-in ballots. They were again rebuffed. The latest recount there should be done by Wednesday. But the rift between Republicans committed to honoring voters at the state level and the White House, which is still trying to ignore them, is an incredible thing to watch. Disconnected. When Trump travels to Georgia to campaign for the Republican Senate candidates there -- Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Purdue -- he'll be simultaneously saying the vote that cost him the White House was fraudulent (it wasn't) and that Republicans should take part in that fraudulent system. Arizona certification. The state handed Biden 11 electoral votes and, more importantly, cleared the way for Mark Kelly, the new Democratic senator, to be sworn in Wednesday.(CNN) - America is sliding into a winter limbo of alarming spikes in Covid-19 cases and deepening economic pain while an apathetic lame duck White House and a deadlocked Congress provide no political leadership.The darkest holiday season in modern history beckons, yet President Donald Trump and his closest aides, sulking after his election defeat, are doing little to save lives, apart from claiming credit for a vaccine that represents a way out of the nightmare of 2020 but remains months away for most Americans.The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and GOP-led Senate will return to Washington this week, but have shown no signs they can get together to ease the consequent economic pain of millions of unemployed Americans amid scenes of long Great Depression-style lines outside food banks.President-elect Joe Biden is moving quickly to put a diverse and experienced team around him -- he rolled out an all-female senior communications team Sunday, and he is expected to announce top economic officials this week. But even a President-elect who promises to replace Trump's neglect with a science-based approach to the pandemic can only do so much before he takes office on January 20, when the health crisis and economic toll are likely to be far worse.The current President spent Sunday firing off delusional new claims to bolster his fantasy that the election was stolen, which did nothing to advance his inept legal cases but further poisoned hopes of national unity when he's gone.By contrast, top government health experts blanketed Sunday talk shows, warning of an alarming post-Thanksgiving rise in Covid cases, overwhelmed hospitals and exhausted health workers and pleaded with a country beset by pandemic fatigue to mitigate the pain and death for a few more months."This is a really dangerous time," government testing czar Adm. Brett Giroir said on CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday.Biden waits in the wingsDevelopments over the Thanksgiving weekend reflected a juxtaposition between an incoming President who is gearing up to tackle a staggering national crisis and a sitting commander-in-chief who retains his authority but is pursuing baseless claims over election fraud that will complicate the task of his successor.It was left to the heads of government health agencies, some of whom were effectively muzzled by the President ahead of the election, to muster national resolve.Since Biden has little capacity to limit the explosion in Covid-19 cases, his most critical initial task will be to preside over the distribution of a vaccine developed by private companies in coordination with the current White House.Giroir, the assistant secretary for health, said on "State of the Union" that he was "really" confident in the plan to distribute the vaccine, ahead of Food and Drug Administration meetings in the coming weeks to consider an emergency use authorization. Highest risk groups, including health workers and elderly people living in assisted living facilities, could start getting injections before the end of the year. A decision is expected after a December 10 meeting of an FDA committee but it could be late spring before most Americans see a vaccine -- or the double shots that some require.Giroir's confidence is encouraging. But it must be seen as another upbeat assessment from an administration that has made repeated optimistic assessments on the provision of protective equipment for front-line workers, falling death rates, expanding testing and forecasts about hospital occupancy that have all proven to be empty.Dr. Megan Ranney, a Brown University emergency physician who has been treating Covid patients, said Sunday that political failures had brewed a disaster in the nation's hospitals."We have been talking for months about the need for increased supplies of personal protective equipment, about the need for increased testing supplies, we still desperately need those," Ranney said on CNN "Newsroom.""But even if those were all available, the trouble is that the surge in Covid-19 patients right now is so great, it is overwhelming hospitals, it is overwhelming available beds and worst of all, it is overwhelming the number of available staff."Grim warnings from top health officialsThe unity of messaging from government health experts over the weekend was remarkable and ominous — and only emphasized the silence of Trump, who has repeatedly lied about the US "rounding the corner" on the crisis, or Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the White House coronavirus task force.Giroir told CNN's Dana Bash that he was "very concerned" about high levels of Thanksgiving travel and asked Americans to avoid high risk areas like bars and other indoors spaces.America's top infectious diseases specialist, Dr. Anthony Fauci, warned of a potential "surge superimposed upon that surge that we're already in" heading into December."We're entering into what really is a precarious situation because we're in the middle of a steep slope," Fauci said on NBC's "Meet the Press."US Surgeon General Jerome Adams pleaded with Americans to stick to mask wearing and social distancing."I want to be straight with the American people, it's going to get worse over the next several weeks," he said on "Fox News Sunday." "The actions that we take in the next several days will determine how bad it is or whether or not we continue to flatten our curve."And another senior member of the White House coronavirus task force, Dr. Deborah Birx, who said she hopes to begin briefing Biden's team this week after a transition delayed by the President, said people who traveled for the holiday should get tested and avoid vulnerable relatives."To every American, this is the moment to protect yourself and your family," Birx said on CBS's "Face the Nation."Pressure mounts on Congress to avert economic devastationWith the President absent, it will fall to governors and mayors to pick up the mantle of leadership again. But a flurry of new restrictions on public gatherings and restrictions on restaurants is likely to further damage an economy that has been hammered by the pandemic.So pressure is rising on Congress to break out of its partisan stasis and offer more help to millions of Americans who are out of work because of the pandemic.Lawmakers will return to Washington after the holiday this week after months of the two chambers failing to pass a new and combined Covid-19 aid package. The prospects for progress still look grim with a funding deal needed to avert a partial government shutdown by December 11. In the past, however, such deadlines have sometimes spurred a modicum of political cover that allows incremental deals. Still, a more comprehensive pandemic package may have to await the arrival of the new President in January. But the reality of divided power in Washington -- pending two runoffs in Georgia that will decide control of the Senate -- and the likelihood that Senate Republicans will rediscover their budget hawk instincts with a Democrat in the White House, only add to Biden's huge problems. There is also concern that the failure of Congress to act will hamper the ability of states to train workers and effectively distribute several vaccine candidates.Biden, who will have further meetings with his transition team this week and is finally due to receive the President's Daily Brief, is pressing ahead with building out his White House team.On Sunday, he named an all-female White House messaging operation, which will include former Obama White House communications director Jen Psaki, a former CNN political commentator, returning to the White House as press secretary and Kate Bedingfield, a top campaign official, as the new West Wing's communications director.The President-elect is also expected to make official the nomination of former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to be the first woman to serve as Treasury secretary. If confirmed, Adewale "Wally" Adeyemo -- Biden's pick for deputy Treasury secretary -- would be the first Black person to hold that powerful position.Biden is expected to build out his diverse economic team with Neera Tanden, who would be the first woman of color to lead the Office of Management and Budget. Tanden, the chief executive of the Center for American Progress, is a controversial figure among some progressives after working as a campaign aide to Hillary Clinton in her 2016 battle for the nomination against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Biden is also poised to name Cecilia Rouse, a Princeton economist, to lead the Council of Economic Advisers, elevating another Black woman in a high-profile role in the incoming administration.While Biden was building a new administration, Trump spent the weekend playing golf, and at Camp David while launching fresh, spurious claims about election fraud. He claimed there was "tremendous cheating" by Democrats in a Fox Business interview that featured almost no pushback from sympathetic anchor Maria Bartiromo.Providing no evidence for his lies about the "greatest fraud in the history of our country," the President more importantly offered no answers or responsibility for the testing days ahead in the worst domestic crisis to afflict the country since World War II.New York  (CNN Business) - President Donald Trump repeatedly warned Americans that if they failed to reelect him, the stock market would implode. In reality, the opposite happened.Between August and October alone, Trump sent six tweets saying markets would "crash" if Joe Biden were elected, using a word presidents typically avoid. "The Dow Jones Industrial just closed above 29,000! You are so lucky to have me as your President," Trump wrote on September 2. "With Joe Hiden' it would crash."Yet no post-election meltdown emerged. If anything, markets melted up as nightmare election scenarios were avoided and investors celebrated coronavirus vaccine breakthroughs from Pfizer and Moderna. The S&P 500 notched its best election week rally since 1932. And despite a sharp pullback Monday, the Dow soared nearly 12% in November, its best month since January 1987. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq enjoyed their best month since April. "In terms of Biden being bad for the market, we can already see the opposite is true," said Daryl Jones, director of research at Hedgeye Risk Management.Wall Street has moved on from TrumpThere's no doubt that Trump's tax cuts and deregulation helped boost markets. His trade war with China and love of tariffs, however, were clear negatives for stocks. Biden is signaling he won't adopt extreme policies that would rattle markets. His economic team, unveiled Monday, is headlined by Janet Yellen, the crisis-tested former Federal Reserve chair with whom investors are very comfortable. "Biden is showing us that from a business and economic standpoint, he's likely to be moderate," Jones said. The strong November performance on Wall Street partially reflects relief that the election removed a huge cloud of uncertainty, even if the votes took time to count. Before the election, there were serious concerns about a constitutional crisis and the transfer of power. But investors have largely shrugged off Trump's avalanche of election-related lawsuits as a sideshow doomed to fail. "The fear was there would be a seriously contested election," said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. "Certainly, it's being contested but there's a recognition there's a very, very slim chance that President Trump will actually succeed in his bid to overturn the election results."Gridlock beats blue waveEven better from Wall Street's perspective, the election failed to produce the blue wave Democrats hoped for. Democrats would need to win both Georgia runoff races in order to get control of the Senate, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris breaking a 50/50 tie. Republicans are the heavy favorites to retain control of the Senate, according to PredictIt, an online prediction market. Divided government in 2021 means Biden won't be able to raise corporate and personal taxes, a huge relief to investors. It will also limit the ability of Democrats to pass sweeping climate legislation. Markets are focused on 'game changer' vaccinesThe celebration on Wall Street comes even as the suffering mounts on Main Street. The pandemic returned this fall with a vengeance, with coronavirus infections and hospitalizations at record highs. Health restrictions are back, and federal relief is expiring. All of this is hammering mom-and-pop shops, movie theaters, hotels, airlines and restaurants. Jobless claims have climbed in back-to-back weeks and the government jobs report due out on Friday is expected to show hiring slowed in November. But investors are looking past the worsening pandemic and focusing instead on enormous progress on vaccines. "The vaccine news is a real game changer," said Hooper. "The stock market has this great ability to look through immediate headwinds to a future that appears brighter."Moderna said Monday that its vaccine is 100% effective against severe Covid-19. That's a huge positive given that just a few months ago there were concerns whether an effective vaccine could ever be developed. Now, there is greater confidence of a stronger economic recovery in 2021 that will include hard-hit sectors like travel. Bank of America economists predict global GDP will surge by 5.4% in 2021, the best year since 1973. US GDP is expected to increase by 4.5%, the strongest since 1999."A year of vaccine not virus, a year of reopening not lockdown, a year of recovery not recession," Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America, wrote in a note Monday.The gap between rich and poor is getting widerThe market boom sends a positive signal that can encourage nervous consumers and corporations to spend instead of hunker down. That, in turn, can boost the real economy.Yet the V-shaped recovery on Wall Street is another example of how the pandemic is worsening inequality. That's because millions of Americans don't get a boost from the market boom. Only about half (52%) of American families have some level of investment in the market, mostly through 401(k)s and other retirement accounts, according to the Pew Research Center. Just 14% of households are directly invested in the market.And the surging stock market is likely exacerbating the divide between rich and poor because affluent families have far more skin in the game. As of the first quarter of 2020, the wealthiest 10% of American households owned 87% of all stocks and mutual funds, according to the Federal Reserve. The middle class, by contrast, owned just 6.6% of stocks, according to NYU professor Edward Wolff. No matter who owns stocks, markets can't go up forever. At some point, the vaccine optimism will all be priced in. The epic rebound on Wall Street — the S&P 500 is up a stunning 61% since the March 23 low — has driven up market valuations to levels unseen since the dotcom bubble.Bank of America's Hartnett argued it would be "silly to think big stock market gains from here" won't cause negative responses, including higher inflation, higher taxes and higher bond yields. That's why he's advising clients to "sell into strength on vaccine in coming months.""We expect peak prices in early '21," Hartnett wrote. (CNN) - President-elect Joe Biden is set to formally name key members of his economic team on Monday, with the long-expected announcement of Janet Yellen as Treasury Secretary, CNN has learned, along with two other women in top roles on a diverse team that will help him navigate the nation's punishing fiscal headwinds in hopes of building an economic recovery.He is expected to name Neera Tanden to lead the Office of Management and Budget, two people familiar with the appointment said, elevating Tanden, the CEO and president of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, into the top ranks of his administration.He's poised to name Cecilia Rouse, a Princeton economist, to lead the Council of Economic Advisers, which would put another Black woman in a high-profile role of Biden's top advisers. Rouse served on the council during the Obama administration.Among the barrier-breaking nominees Biden is announcing is Adewale "Wally" Adeyemo, president of the Obama Foundation in Chicago, for deputy Treasury Secretary, serving under Yellen. If confirmed, he would be the first Black deputy Treasury Secretary. Yellen, if confirmed, would be the first woman to serve as Treasury Secretary.Adeyemo served on the National Economic Council of the Obama administration and last fall was named as the first president of the Obama Foundation. The Wall Street Journal first reported on Biden's expected economic picks.The announcements are expected to be made Monday in a statement, officials said, with the team set to be formally introduced by Biden during an event Tuesday at his transition headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware. RELATED: Here's who could serve in top roles in the Biden administrationThe economic team is among the most critical pieces of the new administration, whose successes or failures will play a large role in determining the course of the Biden presidency.Biden is also still set to name the leader of the National Economic Council, officials said, as well as United States Trade Representative, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other posts.It is unclear whether Biden will name his Commerce Secretary nominee this week, officials said, and the timing of other key economic positions also could be shifted based on final decisions and last-minute adjustments.Several people close to the transition tell CNN this is a glimpse of leading contenders for other key roles on the economic team:Brian Deese, a former top economic adviser in the Obama-Biden administration, is among the leading contenders to head the National Economic Council, officials said. He served as deputy director of the OMB and the NEC and is now a top official at BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager.Roger Ferguson Jr., who served as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, is also seen as a leading contender for the National Economic Council, officials said, but could also be named to another top economic post.Katherine Tai is among the leading contenders to serve as US Trade Representative, officials said, a critical position as the Biden administration moves beyond the trade policies of the Trump era. Tai is the top Democratic trade counsel on the House Ways and Means Committee and oversaw trade enforcement for China during the Obama administration. She also played a key role in negotiating trade policy for Democrats in the US-Mexico Canada Agreement.MAP: See 2020 election resultsThe roster of contenders for the various economic posts inside the West Wing also includes Jared Bernstein, a longtime economic adviser to Biden, along with Gene Sperling, a veteran of the Clinton and Obama administrations, and Ben Harris, who also worked in the Obama administration.Several other candidates have also risen to the top for high-profile economic jobs, officials said, including Heather Boushey, who has been one of Biden's chief economic policy advisers during the campaign, and Lisa Cook, an economist at Michigan State who also worked in the Obama administration.Austan Goolsbee, who served as the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the second term of the Obama administration, has also been mentioned for top posts in the Biden White House. But Goolsbee dismissed that possibility on Sunday, telling CNN's Manu Raju: "I don't plan to be going into the administration."This story has been updated with additional reporting. New York  (CNN Business) - President Donald Trump on Sunday spoke with Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo -- his first TV interview since the election. The conversation was riddled with lies and conspiracy theories.Bartiromo opened the interview with a question about election fraud, telling Trump, "The facts are on your side." Trump responded, falsey saying, "This election was a fraud; it was a rigged election." The Fox anchor then reflected the president's anger, saying, "This is disgusting and we cannot allow America's election to be corrupted."The interview highlighted that Trump is "unable or unwilling to accept reality," CNN's Chief Media Correspondent Brian Stelter said on "Reliable Sources" Sunday. Trump spewed misinformation throughout the conversation. False allegations of voting issues"We had glitches where they moved thousands of votes from my account to Biden's account," Trump falsely told Bartiromo as he continued to bash mail-in voting and incorrectly claimed "dead people were applying to get a ballot." In addition to Trump's unwillingness to acknowledge Joe Biden won the election, Bartiromo's unchallenged acceptance of Trump's false narrative also presents a danger to American democracy, said CNN's Senior Media Reporter Oliver Darcy on "Reliable Sources.""News organizations — and I think Fox claims to be one — have a responsibility," Darcy said. "The president of the United States is trying to overturn the election. ...Frankly, there is not much daylight between Maria and [Infowars conspiracy theorist] Alex Jones."Bartiromo's journalism career goes back more than 25 years. She created a name for herself when she launched CNBC's morning show "Squawk Box" and anchored "The Closing Bell with Maria Bartiromo" and "On the Money with Maria Bartiromo." In 1995, she made history as the first reporter to broadcast live from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.But much of the media world has shifted its perspective on her after she went to Fox News. "Maria Bartiromo, once a feared and acclaimed journalist, best known for working the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, forcing CEOs to tell the truth, now sits behind a desk and invites the president to lie and lie and lie," Stelter said.Trump's disinformation campaign about the election is less a cohesive strategy and more about throwing spaghetti at the wall in the hope that something sticks, said Jonathan Rauch, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution said, "What he's running right now is a classic Russian-style disinformation campaign," Rauch said.He added that Trump's intention is to "flood the zone" and "confuse people" by pushing out conspiracy theories, lies and half-truths. The fact that his conspiracy theories have gained so much traction shows that Trump's strategy has been effective at gaining support from Republicans -- if not for overturning the election result. When it comes to Trump's skills in this area, Rauch said, "I think he's better than Putin."Rauch added that President-elect Joe Biden has done a good job of "not rising to the bait of every single conspiracy that's thrown out there."'I came up with vaccines'Nearly an hour into the interview, Trump finally discussed the coronavirus pandemic that continues to spiral out of control.Although America continues to hit new records for coronavirus infections, Trump claimed that the United States is more in control of the pandemic than other nations, a fact belied by America's higher infection rate than many countries."We're doing better than the rest of the world," Trump told Bartiromo, speaking about the way the coronavirus has been handled in the United States. As of Sunday, there are more than 13 million Covid-19 cases in the United States and more than 266,000 people in the United States have died from Covid-19 complications.Trump also took credit for drug companies' vaccine trials, which have resulted in far-better-than-expected efficacy rates. The Trump administration's "Operation Warp Speed" funded some pharmaceutical companies' research, development and eventual distribution of the vaccine, but some companies with successful vaccine trials -- such as Pfizer -- did not participate in the administration's program."I came up with vaccines that people didn't think we'd have for five years," Trump said. In fact, pharmaceutical companies -- including Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Novavax -- created the vaccines. Sunday's interview came after a long streak of silence for Trump. People who work closely with the president have avoided answering questions about the election, avoiding questions about the president's efforts to overturn the election.(CNN) - Canada is putting the kibosh on President Donald Trump's efforts to lower drug prices by importing medications from our northern neighbor.Canadian health minister Patty Hajdu on Friday announced new measures to protect the country's drug supply from bulk importations that could worsen drug shortages. It bars the distribution of certain drugs outside of Canada if that would cause or worsen a shortage. "Our health care system is a symbol of our national identity and we are committed to defending it," Hajdu said. "The actions we are taking today will help protect Canadians' access to the medication they rely on."Importing drugs from abroad, particularly Canada, is a centerpiece in Trump's plan to reduce prices, a key priority of his campaign and first term. After the President issued an executive order in July that pushed to allow such importations, the Department of Health and Human Services issued in a final rule in late September establishing a path for states and certain other entities to set up drug importation programs.President-elect Joe Biden has also expressed interest in allowing consumers to import drugs from other countries as along as the federal government deems them safe.Last week, Florida became the first state to submit an importation proposal to the federal agency to create such a program under the newly issued rule. The plan calls for initially importing several classes of drugs, including maintenance medications to help those with chronic health conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS. Several other states, including Vermont, Colorado, New Mexico and Maine, have also passed laws to pursue federal approval for importation.In response to the growing momentum, a trio of pharmaceutical industry groups last week filed a court challenge to importation, saying the effort would jeopardize Americans' health and fail to reduce prices."The final rule fails to overcome the well-documented safety concerns regarding importation expressed for nearly two decades by previous HHS secretaries across party lines or to make any showing that the proposal would result in any—let alone significant—cost savings to American consumers," said James Stansel, general counsel at PhRMA, the main industry lobbying group.Health policy experts have also questioned the effectiveness of importing drugs from Canada -- where an independent body established by Parliament ensures that brand-name drug prices are not excessive. Even HHS Secretary Alex Azar called it a "gimmick" in 2018, before changing his tune.In announcing the measures last week, Canada's Health Ministry said it has repeatedly stated that the US rule would not do much to reduce prices in America since Canada represents only 2% of global pharmaceutical sales, while the US accounts for 44% of sales.The Canadian Pharmacists Association has warned that the nation already suffers from drug shortages, which have grown worse during the coronavirus pandemic. Last year, days before then-Democratic presidential primary contender Bernie Sanders went north with diabetes patients seeking cheaper insulin, a coalition of 15 Canadian medical professional and patient groups pressed the government to protect the country's pharmaceutical supply.Though it has only weeks left in office, the Trump administration has recently pushed through several measures aimed at lowering drug prices. Earlier this month, it unveiled two controversial rules that immediately sparked legal threats from the pharmaceutical industry.One will have Medicare pay the same price for certain expensive prescription drugs as other developed nations, a "most-favored-nation price."The other will effectively ban drug makers from providing rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and insurers -- a radical change in the way many drugs are priced and paid for in Medicare and Medicaid. Instead, drug companies will be encouraged to pass the discounts directly to patients at the pharmacy counter. The administration had backed away from issuing this rule last year after it was found to raise costs for senior citizens and the federal government.(CNN) - The Wisconsin Elections Commission finalized the state's presidential results on Monday, affirming President-elect Joe Biden's victory after a recount in Wisconsin's two most populous counties.MAP: See 2020 election resultsWisconsin Elections Commission Chairwoman Ann Jacobs signed the official paperwork stating that Biden "received the greatest number of votes" and was entitled to the state's 10 electoral votes.It is now up to Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, to sign the paperwork formally awarding those electoral votes to Biden. It's unclear how fast he will act. His team has not answered CNN's inquiries on the matter.President Donald Trump's campaign has pledged to further challenge the state's results in court.This is a breaking story and will be updated.(CNN) - Callie Brownson, the chief of staff for the Cleveland Browns, became the first woman to be a position coach for an NFL team in Sunday's game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.  That means Brownson is the highest-ranking female coach in league history, according to Sam Rapoport, the NFL's senior director of diversity, equality and inclusion.Brownson was made the interim tight ends coach for the game after coach Drew Petzing was unable to travel. His wife, Louisa, gave birth to the couple's first child Saturday morning, according to the Cleveland Browns.  Before the game in Jacksonville, Brownson appeared to respond on Twitter to the announcement, saying, "I'm just, thankful."One of her players, tight end Austin Hooper, scored a touchdown in the game and helped lift the Browns to win 27-25 over the Jaguars. "I never wanted to be the first," Brownson told the Huffington Post in September 2018, when she became made history as the first female assistant coach for Dartmouth and a Division 1 football team. "I just wanted to live in a time when it was possible."It's been a historic time for women in football. Just this past weekend, Sarah Fuller made history as the first woman to play in a Power 5 college football game.In 2019, Sarah Thomas became the first woman to officiate an NFL playoff game.  Recent historic accomplishments by women in the NFL, and the frequency of them, aren't a coincidence.  Rapoport likened it to a snowball effect started by the NFL's Women's Careers in Football Forum, first held in 2017. That initiative, held this year during the NFL scouting combine, has created a talent pipeline connecting women working in college football with leaders in professional and collegiate football. Bronson attended the forum in 2017 and went on to work with the New York Jets in scouting. She was then hired as a coaching intern with the Buffalo Bills, according to a Cleveland Browns news release.  "I think without question we are going to see (a female general manager) and head coach. It's just a matter of when, it's just a matter of that pipeline," Rapoport said. "That person, that woman, is ready." In 2016, the NFL announced changes to its Rooney Rule, which mandates that all teams must interview at least one minority candidate for head coach and senior coach positions. The changes require teams to interview minority candidates for additional positions, in addition to female candidates for senior-level job positions.(CNN) - London — A group of frontline medical workers, likely exhausted, stand huddled together on a video-conference call as China's most powerful man raises his hand in greeting. It is February 10 in Beijing and President Xi Jinping, who for weeks has been absent from public view, is addressing hospital staff in the city of Wuhan as they battle to contain the spread of a still officially unnamed novel coronavirus.From a secure room about 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) from the epicenter, Xi expressed his condolences to those who have died in the outbreak. He urged greater public communication, as around the world concerns mounted about the potential threat posed by the new disease.That same day, Chinese authorities reported 2,478 new confirmed cases -- raising the total global number to more than 40,000, with fewer than 400 cases occurring outside of mainland China. Yet CNN can now reveal how official documents circulated internally show that this was only part of the picture.In a report marked "internal document, please keep confidential," local health authorities in the province of Hubei, where the virus was first detected, list a total of 5,918 newly detected cases on February 10, more than double the official public number of confirmed cases, breaking down the total into a variety of subcategories. This larger figure was never fully revealed at that time, as China's accounting system seemed, in the tumult of the early weeks of the pandemic, to downplay the severity of the outbreak.The previously undisclosed figure is among a string of revelations contained within 117 pages of leaked documents from the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, shared with and verified by CNN.Taken together, the documents amount to the most significant leak from inside China since the beginning of the pandemic and provide the first clear window into what local authorities knew internally and when.The Chinese government has steadfastly rejected accusations made by the United States and other Western governments that it deliberately concealed information relating to the virus, maintaining that it has been upfront since the beginning of the outbreak. However, though the documents provide no evidence of a deliberate attempt to obfuscate findings, they do reveal numerous inconsistencies in what authorities believed to be happening and what was revealed to the public.The documents, which cover an incomplete period between October 2019 and April this year, reveal what appears to be an inflexible health care system constrained by top-down bureaucracy and rigid procedures that were ill-equipped to deal with the emerging crisis. At several critical moments in the early phase of the pandemic, the documents show evidence of clear missteps and point to a pattern of institutional failings.One of the more striking data points concerns the slowness with which local Covid-19 patients were diagnosed. Even as authorities in Hubei presented their handling of the initial outbreak to the public as efficient and transparent, the documents show that local health officials were reliant on flawed testing and reporting mechanisms. A report in the documents from early March says the average time between the onset of symptoms to confirmed diagnosis was 23.3 days, which experts have told CNN would have significantly hampered steps to both monitor and combat the disease.China has staunchly defended its handling of the outbreak. At a news conference on June 7, China's State Council released a White Paper saying the Chinese government had always published information related to the epidemic in a "timely, open and transparent fashion.""While making an all-out effort to contain the virus, China has also acted with a keen sense of responsibility to humanity, its people, posterity, and the international community. It has provided information on Covid-19 in a thoroughly professional and efficient way. It has released authoritative and detailed information as early as possible on a regular basis, thus effectively responding to public concern and building public consensus," says the White Paper.CNN has reached out to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and National Health Commission, as well as Hubei's Health Commission, which oversees the provincial CDC, for comment on the findings disclosed in the documents, but received no response.Health experts said the documents laid bare why what China knew in the early months mattered. "It was clear they did make mistakes -- and not just mistakes that happen when you're dealing with a novel virus -- also bureaucratic and politically-motivated errors in how they handled it," said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, who has written extensively on public health in China. "These had global consequences. You can never guarantee 100% transparency. It's not just about any intentional cover-up, you are also constrained with by technology and other issues with a novel virus. But even if they had been 100% transparent, that would not stop the Trump administration downplaying the seriousness of it. It would probably not have stopped this developing into a pandemic."Tuesday, December 1, marks one year since the first known patient showed symptoms of the disease in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan, according to a key study in the Lancet medical journal. At the same time that the virus is believed to have first emerged, the documents show another health crisis was unfolding: Hubei was dealing with a significant influenza outbreak. It caused cases to rise to 20 times the level recorded the previous year, the documents show, placing enormous levels of additional stress on an already stretched health care system.The influenza "epidemic," as officials noted in the document, was not only present in Wuhan in December, but was greatest in the neighboring cities of Yichang and Xianning. It remains unclear what impact or connection the influenza spike had on the Covid-19 outbreak. And while there is no suggestion in the documents the two parallel crises are linked, information regarding the magnitude of Hubei's influenza spike has still yet to be made public.The leaked revelations come as pressure builds from the US and the European Union on China to fully cooperate with a World Health Organization inquiry into the origins of the virus that has since spread to every corner of the globe, infecting more than 60 million people and killing 1.46 million. But, so far, access for international experts to hospital medial records and raw data in Hubei has been limited, with the WHO saying last week they had "reassurances from our Chinese government colleagues that a trip to the field" would be granted as part of their investigation.The files were presented to CNN by a whistleblower who requested anonymity. They said they worked inside the Chinese healthcare system, and were a patriot motivated to expose a truth that had been censored, and honor colleagues who had also spoken out. It is unclear how the documents were obtained or why specific papers were selected.The documents have been verified by six independent experts who examined the veracity of their content on behalf of CNN. One expert with close ties to China reported seeing some of the reports during confidential research earlier this year. A European security official with knowledge of Chinese internal documents and procedures also confirmed to CNN that the files were genuine.Metadata from the files seen by CNN contains the names of serving CDC officials as modifiers and authors. The metadata creation dates align with the content of the documents. Digital forensic analysis was also performed to test their computer code against their purported origins.Sarah Morris, from the Digital Forensics Unit at Britain's Cranfield University, said there was no evidence the data had been tampered with or was misleading. She added the older files looked like they had been used repeatedly over a long period of time. "It's almost like a mini file system," she said. "So, it's got lots of room for deleted stuff, for old things. That's a really good sign [of authenticity]."World got more optimistic data than realityThe documents show a wide-range of data on two specific days, February 10 and March 7, that is often at odds with what officials said publicly at the time. This discrepancy was likely due to a combination of a highly dysfunctional reporting system and a recurrent instinct to suppress bad news, said analysts. These documents show the full extent of what officials knew, but chose not to spell out to the public.On February 10, when China reported 2,478 new confirmed cases nationwide, the documents show Hubei actually circulated a different total of 5,918 newly reported cases. The internal number is divided into subcategories, providing an insight into the full scope of Hubei's diagnosis methodology at the time."Confirmed cases" number 2,345, "clinically diagnosed cases" 1,772, and "suspected cases" 1,796.The strict and limiting criteria led ultimately to misleading figures, said analysts. "A lot of the suspected cases there should have been included with the confirmed cases," said Huang, from the Council on Foreign Relations, who reviewed the documents and found them to be authentic. "The numbers they were giving out were conservative, and this reflects how confusing, complex and chaotic the situation was," he added.That month, Hubei officials presented a daily number of "confirmed cases," and then included later in their statements "suspected cases," without specifying the number of seriously ill patients who had been diagnosed by doctors as being "clinically diagnosed." Often in nationwide tolls, officials would give the daily new "confirmed" cases, and provide a running tally for the entire pandemic of "suspected cases," also into which it seems the "clinically diagnosed" were added. This use of a broad "suspected case" tally effectively downplayed the severity of patients who doctors had seen and determined were infected, according to stringent criteria, experts said.William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University, said the Chinese approach was conservative, and the data "would have been presented in a different way had US epidemiologists been there to assist."He said Chinese officials "seemed actually to minimize the impact of the epidemic at any moment in time. To include patients who were suspected of having the infection obviously would have expanded the size of outbreak and would have given, I think, a truer appreciation of the nature of the infection and its size."Protocols for coronavirus diagnosis, published by China's National Health Commission in late January, told doctors to label a case "suspected" if a patient had contact history with known cases, and a fever and pneumonia symptoms, and to elevate the case to "clinically diagnosed" if those symptoms were confirmed by an X-ray or CT scan. A case would only be "confirmed" if polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or genetic sequencing tests came back positive.Andrew Mertha, director of the China Studies Program at John Hopkins University, said officials might have been motivated to "lowball" numbers to disguise under-funding and preparedness issues in local health care bodies like the provincial CDC.According to Mertha, the documents, which he reviewed and considered authentic, seemed to be organized so as to allow senior officials to paint whatever picture they wished. "You are giving them all the options there without putting somebody in an explicitly embarrassing position -- giving them both the anvil or the life-raft to then choose from."
Chinese officials did soon improve the reporting system, placing the "clinically diagnosed" cases into the "confirmed" category by mid-February. Top health and provincial officials in Hubei were also removed from their positions at that time, who would have been ultimately responsible for the reporting. Furthermore, wider and improved testing meant "suspected" cases could be clarified quicker and featured less in reporting. Separately, China's diagnostic criteria have been criticized by health experts for their continued, public decision to not count asymptomatic cases.Death tolls listed in the documents reveal the starkest discrepancies. On March 7, the total death toll in Hubei since the beginning of the outbreak stood at 2,986, but in the internal report it is listed as 3,456, including 2,675 confirmed deaths, 647 "clinically diagnosed" deaths, and 126 "suspected" case deaths.Dali Yang, who has extensively studied the outbreak's origins, said that in February numbers "still mattered because of global perceptions.""They were still hoping it was like 2003, and like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) would be eventually contained, and everything can go back to normal," added Yang, who is a professor of political science at the University of Chicago. He pointed to the February 7 call between presidents Trump and Xi. "I think that's also the (wishful) impression that Trump got -- that this is going to disappear."The documents, however, are by no means clear cut. On two occasions, the public death numbers are narrowly over reported, with the internal figures indicating single-digit discrepancies of five and one, respectively. On other occasions, the data provides glimpses of new information but without vital context. Even though China has never revealed the total number of Covid-19 cases in 2019, a graph in one document appears to suggest a much higher number had been detected. In the bottom left hand column of the graph marked 2019 the number of "confirmed cases" and "clinically diagnosed" cases appears to reach around 200 altogether. The documents do not elaborate further. To date, the clearest indication of how many cases were detected in 2019 is the 44 "cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology (unknown cause)" that Chinese authorities reported to the WHO for the period of the pandemic up to January 3, 2020.Long wait time for testsTesting was inaccurate from the start, the documents said, and led to a reporting system with weeks long delays in diagnosing new cases. Experts said that meant most of the daily figures that informed the government response risked being inaccurate or dated.On January 10, one of the documents reveals how during an audit of testing facilities, officials reported that the SARS testing kits that were being used to diagnose the new virus were ineffective, regularly giving false negatives. It also indicated that poor levels of personal protective equipment meant that virus samples had to be made inactive before testing.The high false-negative rate exposed a series of problems China would take weeks to rectify. According to reports in Chinese state media in early February, Hubei health experts had expressed frustration with the accuracy of nucleic acid tests. Nucleic acid tests work by detecting the virus' genetic code, and were thought to be more effective at detecting the infection, particularly in the early stages. However, the tests carried out at that time resulted in only a 30% to 50% positive rate, among already confirmed cases, according to officials quoted in state media. In order to avoid "false negative" results, health officials began to test suspected cases repeatedly.By early February, laboratories in Hubei had capacity to test more than 10,000 people a day, according to state media reports. To cope with the high volume, officials decided to begin incorporating other clinical diagnosis methods, such as CT scans. This led to the creation of category referred to internally as "clinically diagnosed cases." It was not until mid-February that the clinically diagnosed cases were added to the confirmed case numbers. Other, yet graver issues noted in the documents were raised by health experts. In the first months of the outbreak, the average time required to process a case -- from the patient experiencing symptoms (onset) to being confirmed diagnosed was 23.3 days.The persistent delay would likely have made it much harder to direct public health interventions, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. "You're looking at data that's three weeks old and trying to make a decision for today," he said.The report notes that, by March 7, the system had much improved, with over 80% of the new confirmed cases diagnosed that day being recorded in the system that same day.Multiple experts described the time lag as extraordinary, even when factoring in the initial difficulties faced by authorities."That adds another layer of understanding as to why some of the numbers that came out from the higher levels of government probably were off," said Schaffner from Vanderbilt University. "In the United States, Britain, France and Germany, there's always a lag. You don't know instantaneously. But 23 days is a long time."Early warning system hampered A lack of preparedness is reflected throughout the documents, sections of which are highly critical in their internal assessment of the government's support for the Center for Disease Control and Prevention operations in Hubei. The report characterizes the Hubei CDC as underfunded, lacking the right testing equipment, and with unmotivated staff who were often felt ignored in China's vast bureaucracy.The documents include an internal audit, which forensic analysis shows was written in October 2019, before the pandemic began.More than a month before the first cases are believed to have emerged, the review continues to urge the health authorities to "rigorously find the weak link in the work of disease control, actively analyze and make up for the shortcomings."The CDC internal report complains over an absence of operational funding from the Hubei provincial government and notes the staffing budget is 29% short of its annual target.After the outbreak, Chinese officials swiftly moved to assess the problems. Yet more than four months after the virus was first identified, major issues continued to hamper disease control efforts in key areas, the documents show.The report also highlights the CDC's peripheral role in investigating the initial outbreak, noting that staff were constrained by official processes and their expertise not fully utilized. Rather than taking a lead, the report suggests CDC staff were resigned to "passively" completing the task issued by superiors.Officials were also faced with a lumbering and unresponsive IT network, known as the China Infectious Disease Direct Reporting System, according to state media, installed at cost of $167 million after the 2003 SARS outbreak.Theoretically, the system was supposed to enable regional hospitals and CDCs to directly report infectious diseases to a centrally managed system. This would then allow the data to be shared instantly with CDCs and relevant health departments nationwide. In reality, it was slow to log into, one audit said, and many other bureaucratic procedural restrictions hampered rapid data recording and gathering.According to Huang, from the Council on Foreign Relations, the report belies China's claim to have massively invested in disease control and prevention after the 2003 SARS outbreak."If you look at the local level, the picture is not as rosy as the government had claimed," he said.Large outbreak of flu in Hubei The documents also reveal a previously undisclosed a 20-fold spike in influenza cases recorded in one week in early December in Hubei province.The spike, which occurred in the week beginning December 2, saw cases rise by approximately 2,059% compared to the same week the year before, according to the internal data.Notably, the outbreak that week is not felt most severely in Wuhan -- the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak -- but in the nearby cities of Yichang, with 6,135 cases, and Xianning, with 2,148 cases. Wuhan was the third worst hit with 2,032 new cases that week.Public data shows a nationwide spike in influenza in December. Experts, however, note the rise in influenza cases, while not unique to Hubei, would have complicated the task of officials on the lookout for new dangerous viruses.Though the magnitude of the Hubei flu spike has not been previously reported, it is difficult to draw any hard conclusions, especially in regard to the potential prevalence of previously undetected Covid-19.The documents show that testing carried out on the influenza patients return a high number of unknown results. However, experts cautioned that this did not necessarily indicate that the unknown test results were in fact undetected coronavirus cases."They're only testing for what they know -- this [coronavirus] is an unknown unknown," said Adalja, the JHU academic, adding that such a scenario that was not uncommon, globally."We're just not that great at diagnosing them. We look for the usual suspects. We're always looking for the horses, but never the zebras."The Wuhan CDC later conducted retrospective research into influenza cases dated as early as October 2019 in two Wuhan hospitals, in an attempt to look for traces of coronavirus. But, according to a study published in the journal Nature, they were unable to detect samples of the virus dating back earlier than January 2020. Similar studies have yet to be carried out in other Hubei cities.Separately, the flu spike could have helped to unintentionally accelerate the coronavirus' early spread, said Huang. "Those people were seeking care in hospitals, increasing the chances of COVID infection there," he said.The influenza data also points to the influenza outbreak being worst in Yichang. While the influenza spike and the emergence of Covid-19 are not linked in the documents or by other evidence, data pinpointing a flu-like outbreak in multiple cities in Hubei will likely be of interest to those researching the origins of the disease.The Chinese government has previously pointed to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan as the likely initial epicenter of the outbreak in mid-December, where meat of exotic wild animals was sold. Yet that claim has been at least partially challenged by a Lancet study of the first December patients, which determined one third of the 41 infected that month had no direct connection to that market.Yichang, 320 kilometers (198 miles) west of Wuhan, was hit hardest by the influenza outbreak -- almost three times as many as Wuhan in the same week beginning December 2.Mertha, the China expert from JHU, said the spike in Yichang, while not connected to Covid-19 in the documents, could nonetheless open up new theories about where the virus began. "The order of magnitude of change means there has to be something going on," he said.An unfolding crisis China's leaders were the first to confront the virus, implementing a raft of draconian restrictions beginning in late January intended to curb the spread of the outbreak. Using sophisticated surveillance tools, government officials enforced strict lockdowns across the country, largely restricting more than 700 million people to their homes, while sealing national borders and carrying out widespread testing and contract tracing.According to a study published in the journal Science in May, the stringent measures adopted during those first 50 days of the pandemic likely helped break the localized chain of transmission. Today, China is close to zero local cases and although small-scale outbreaks continue to flare, the virus is mostly contained.In February, however, it was a different story. As case numbers soared nationwide, government officials were facing a potential crisis of legitimacy, with public opinion fast turning against the ruling Communist Party over its perceived mishandling of the deadly new disease.During the last 30 years, analysts say, many in China have appeared willing to relinquish political freedoms in return for increased material wealth, social stability and greater opportunities.The virus fundamentally threatened that social contract -- putting hundreds of millions at risk while damaging an economy already weakened by an ongoing US-China trade war. In late January, Xi, China's most powerful leader in decades, publicly ordered "all-out efforts" to contain the virus' spread.At the time, China was celebrating the Lunar New Year holiday, its most important annual holiday. The notion of an impending pandemic seemed to many like an abstract distraction, as people returned home to spend time with their families.Xi's highly public intervention, which came just days after Wuhan was placed under lockdown, carried with it a clear message: Failure is not an option.Throughout this period, the gulf between public statements by Chinese officials and the internally distributed data is at times blunt. The leaked documents show the daily confirmed death toll in Hubei rose to 196 on February 17. That same day, Hubei publicly reported just 93 virus deaths.Another report also records the deaths of six health care workers from Covid-19 by February 10. Their deaths were not public at the time, and were highly sensitive, given the volume of sympathy over-worked health care staff, on the frontline of the pandemic, were getting on social media at the time.As the virus spread, local officials were accused of downplaying the outbreak and its risk to the public. In late December, a young doctor named Li Wenliang in one of Wuhan's main hospitals, was among other medical workers summoned by local authorities and later received formal "reprimand" from the police for attempting to raise the alarm about a potential "SARS-like" virus. State media reported their punishment and warned public against rumour mongering.Li, 34, later contracted the disease. His condition quickly worsened and in the early morning of February 7 he died, resulting in almost unprecedented levels of anger and outrage across mainland China's heavily censored internet.It is not clear to what extent the central government was aware of the actions taking place in Hubei at that time, or how much information was being shared and with whom. The documents offer no indication that authorities in Beijing were directing the local decision-making process. 
However, Mertha, the JHU academic, said the mismatch between the higher internal and lower public figures on the February death toll "appeared to be a deception, for unsurprising reasons.""China had an image to protect internationally, and lower-ranking officials had a clear incentive to under-report -- or to show their superiors that they were under-reporting -- to outside eyes," he said.Conversely, however, the leaked documents also provide something of a defense of China's overall handling of the virus. The reports show that in the early stages of the pandemic, China faced the same problems of accounting, testing, and diagnosis that still haunt many Western democracies even now -- issues compounded by Hubei encountering an entirely new virus.Similarly, no mention is made by officials of a so-called laboratory leak, or that the virus was man-made, as some critics, including top US officials, have claimed without evidence. There is one mention of sub-par facilities at a bacterial and toxic species preservation center, though the point is not elaborated on, nor is its significance made clear.China and its healthcare workers were under immense strain as the outbreak took hold, said Yang, from the Council of Foreign Relations. "They had a massive run on the medical system. They were overwhelmed. There was truly despair among medical professionals by the end of January, because they were extremely overworked and they were also enormously discouraged by the high number of deaths that were occurring with a disease they had not treated previously," he added.Hubei, which lags far behind Beijing, Shanghai and other major Chinese administrative divisions in terms of GDP per capita, was the first region to confront a virus that would go on to confound many of the world's most powerful countries.Schaffner, from Vanderbilt University, said many of the comments in the documents might have been made in the US, "where, over the past 15 to 20 years, at particularly the state and the local level, public health funding has become constrained."The documents show health care officials had no comprehension as to the magnitude of the impending disaster.Nowhere in the files is it indicated that officials believed the virus would become a global pandemic.Tuesday marks exactly 12 months since the first patient in Wuhan started showing symptoms, according to the Lancet study. The death toll and number of people infected by the virus, now known to the world as Covid-19 and impacting the lives across the planet, continues to grow, day on day.(CNN) - The Iranian nuclear scientist assassinated east of Tehran was shot by a remote-controlled machine gun operating out of another car, the semi-official Fars News Agency said Sunday. With top Iranian officials blaming Israel, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei and others have promised revenge for the Friday killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who was the country's chief nuclear scientist.There were conflicting accounts from Iranian news agencies about how the attack unfolded.The Fars News report said Fakhrizadeh was traveling with his wife in a bulletproof car, alongside three security personnel vehicles, when he heard what sounded like bullets hitting a vehicle, and he exited the car to determine what had happened.When he got out, a remote-controlled machine gun opened fire from a Nissan stopped about 150 meters (164 yards) from Fakhrizadeh's car, the agency said.Fakhrizadeh was hit at least three times, according to Fars News. His bodyguard was also shot. Following the gunfire, the Nissan exploded, the news agency reported, adding the attack lasted three minutes.CNN cannot independently confirm Fars News' version of events. The semi-official Iranian Students News Agency also reported Fakhrizadeh's car was hit by gunfire, followed by an explosion and more gunfire. ISNA cited Iranian Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Amir Hatami as its source. "Based on reports received from members of his security detail, Mr. Fakhrizadeh's vehicle was initially targeted by gunfire, after which a Nissan vehicle laden with explosives was set off in close proximity to them as gunfire, targeting their vehicle, was continuing," Hatami was quoted as saying.Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, a state television outlet, said the explosion happened first, followed by gunfire from attackers.Seyed Kamal Kharrazi, the head of Iran's Strategic Council on Foreign Relations, compared the assassination to the killing of Qasem Soleimani, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported Sunday. Soleimani, the leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps' Quds Force, was killed in a US drone strike earlier this year in Iraq."Undoubtedly, the Islamic Republic of Iran will give a calculated and decisive answer to the criminals who took Martyr Fakhrizadeh," Kharrazi was quoted as saying. Fakhrizadeh was the head of the research center of new technology in the elite Revolutionary Guards and was a leading figure in Iran's nuclear program.Iranian leaders blame IsraelKhameini wrote Saturday on a Twitter account that often carries his official statements, "Mr Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was killed by the oppressive enemies. This rare scientific mind lost his life for his everlasting great scientific work. He lost his life for God and the supreme leader."Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called on the international community "to end their shameful double standards" and "condemn this act of state terror." He added that the attack showed "serious indications of Israeli role."Maj. Gen. Hossein Dehghan, Khamenei's military adviser, tweeted Saturday that "Zionists" are seeking to create "all-out war" and vowed to "descend like lightning" on Fakhrizadeh's killers.President Hassan Rouhani, also among the many Iranian leaders blaming Israel, promised retaliation as well, saying during a cabinet meeting Saturday, "The think tanks and the enemies of Iran must know that the Iranian nation and the officials in charge in the country are brave and determined to respond to the murder in time."The killing, he said, was carried out at "the filthy hands of oppressors, in concert with the illegitimate Zionist regime."Iran has provided no evidence of Israeli involvement. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office declined to comment to CNN on Friday.Israeli Settlement Affairs Minister Tzachi Hanegbi told Israel's Channel 12 he didn't know who killed Fakhrizadeh, but called it "very embarrassing for Iran."The US State Department and International Atomic Energy Agency have said in multiple reports that Fakhrizadeh held deep insight into the Islamic Republic's nuclear capabilities. In 2018, Netanyahu said Fakhrizadeh was the head of Project Amad, which he and others describe as a secret nuclear weapons endeavor. "Remember that name, Fakhrizadeh," the prime minister told reporters at the time.Protests erupt in TehranThe killing threatens to compound tensions in Tehran-Washington relations, which have deteriorated under US President Donald Trump. In 2018, Trump pulled out of a multilateral nuclear deal with Iran, and Iran began withdrawing its commitments from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action last year. Trump has invoked crippling economic sanctions on the country.  The White House is closely monitoring Fakhrizadeh's killing, it said. On Friday, Trump retweeted Israeli journalist Yossi Melman, who wrote that Fakhrizadeh "was head of Iran's secret military program and wanted for many years by Mossad," Israel's foreign intelligence agency. Students and young Iranians have converged on several government buildings in Tehran, and at one demonstration outside the Foreign Ministry on Saturday, protesters burned US and Israeli flags and posters depicting Trump and President-elect Joe Biden.The European Union condemned the killing and called for "maximum restraint," while the United Kingdom's Foreign Office said it was "urgently trying to establish the facts."The funeral and burial of Fakhrizadeh will be held Monday, Fars News reported. Fakhrizadeh's remains were taken to the shrine of Imam Reza, one of the most important religious hubs for Shias, in Mashhad on Saturday. Following a Sunday service in Mashhad, his body was expected to be taken to Tehran to the tomb of Ayatollah Khomeini, the Islamic republic's founder.(CNN) - David Chang just became the first celebrity to win the top prize in "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" And the chef decided to give it all to a good cause -- he's donating the entire $1 million prize to restaurant workers who have been impacted by the pandemic. In the nail-biting final moments of the episode Sunday, host Jimmy Kimmel watched as the Momofuku founder struggled over the last question. "No (celebrity) has ever gone for it," Kimmel said. "They've all walked away." For his final question, Chang was asked to name the first US president to have electricity in the White House. "This is the most painful, nervous -- this is terrifying," Chang can be heard saying in a clip from the episode. After phoning a friend -- ESPN journalist Mina Kimes -- Chang guessed President Benjamin Harrison, despite admittedly not even knowing whether Harrison was a president. The sound of screams and a gentleman with a gigantic check had Chang jumping from his chair. He had won. Chang had always intended on donating the money to the Southern Smoke Foundation, a crisis relief organization for people in the food and beverage industry. If Chang had decided not to answer the question, he would have walked away with roughly $500,000. Instead, he decided to risk it all for the sake of doubling that donation. "Having a million dollars right now in this moment, is a game changer for many, many families," Chang says in the video clip of the episode. "And yes, half a million is as well -- and I want to say 'No, just take the money!' -- but I'm not." While restaurants and bars were classified by states as essential businesses that could operate on takeout and delivery, many still had to close down during stay-at-home orders. Some businesses found it hard, or economically unfeasible to adopt that model, or had other public health concerns.The Southern Smoke Foundation, started in 2015 by chef Chris Shepherd, has distributed $4,097,425 to 2,071 people nationwide, according to its website. "To date, Southern Smoke has distributed more than $5.7 million, both directly to people in need via the Emergency Relief Fund and to organizations that represent the needs of people in our industry," the organization says on its website.The organization tweeted the news of Chang's win, exclaiming "WE WON A MILLION DOLLARS!" "I'm so honored that Dave chose Southern Smoke as his charity," Shepherd told CNN. "Now, more than ever, with indoor dining shut down in many parts of the country and temperatures dropping to prohibit outdoor dining, food and beverage industry employees are desperate." Southern Smoke estimates that Chang's donation will help 500 food and beverage workers.(CNN) - Despite what President Donald Trump is tweeting and saying publicly in the wake of Arizona and Wisconsin certifying President-elect Joe Biden's victory Monday, Trump sees the scoreboard and understands he has no chance of hanging on to the presidency, two White House advisers told CNN.Asked whether the President realizes that he's been defeated, a close adviser who has been in contact with Trump about his legal strategy said Monday: "Yes, he does."The same adviser told CNN that Trump will continue to pursue his legal challenges until they are exhausted, but that adviser pointed to the certification in Wisconsin and said, "The writing is on the wall." Without the ability to override the results in a combination of states, not to mention even one state, the adviser said Trump's election challenges are obviously doomed.Trump is still sounding as if he could still win because he wants to believe it, the adviser continued. But the adviser added Trump is fully aware that he has lost.Trump has not conceded the election and he still falsely claims that he won, but his administration has approved access to transition materials and national security briefings for Biden and his team.A separate adviser said the President has understood for some time that it is unlikely he will be able to overturn the election results but that Trump simply does not want to say that out loud. Certifying election results is typically a formality, but the process had been the subject of Trump's long-shot attempt to cling onto power. His campaign has unsuccessfully tried to block or delay certification in key states in hopes of overturning Biden's victory through the Electoral College.Those efforts, though, are nearing an end as states continue to certify their results ahead of the Electoral College meeting on December 14.Wisconsin Democratic Gov. Tony Evers formally certified Biden's victory on Monday, signing the paperwork to award the state's 10 electoral votes to the President-elect after a Trump campaign-requested recount in Wisconsin's two most populous counties.Arizona also certified its election results on Monday, awarding the state's 11 electoral votes to Biden and clearing the way for Senator-elect Mark Kelly, a Democrat, to be sworn in this week.Pennsylvania and Nevada each completed their certification processes last week.Republican Gov. Doug Ducey praised the integrity of Arizona's election system after witnessing Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, certify the election results Monday morning, as required by state law. Ducey said he would sign official documentation on Monday and have it hand-delivered to the president of the US Senate, so that Kelly "can be sworn in as swiftly as possible."In several tweets Monday night, Trump accused Ducey of "rushing to put a Democrat in office," making baseless voter fraud allegations and vowing that "Republicans will long remember!"Trump then sent a number of retweets about Ducey, including one that read, "Who needs Democrats when you have Republicans like Brian Kemp and Doug Ducey?" The President has also recently attacked Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, another member of his own party, over fraud allegations.(CNN) - Mohammed Naiem Asadi and his wife, Rahima, haven't slept well in days. They are too nervous to eat much. They are trying to keep their fear in check for their 4-year-old daughter. But their bodies sometimes betray them.  That's because as of Monday, the US Department of Defense has ejected them from their safe hiding place on a US military base in Afghanistan, putting them at risk from the Taliban, who, Asadi says, have targeted them for killing.  Asadi is a decorated Afghan helicopter pilot credited with protecting US Air Force pilots in Afghanistan and killing more Taliban than any other pilot in the Afghan air force, according to Stars and Stripes, the US military's independent newspaper. The Pentagon would not confirm the Stars and Stripes report on Asadi's record.Asadi and his family say they could now be in grave danger because of a Pentagon decision to reverse permission for them to come to the US and force them to leave the safety of the US military base in Kabul where they have been staying since October 28. There are two options awaiting him outside of US protection, Asadi told CNN in a conversation Sunday, hours before being taken off the base.  'We are so stressed'"If I am sent back to Kabul, I'm afraid I will be jailed by the Afghan government or killed by the Taliban," Asadi said. "We are so stressed." He and his family are now in hiding at an undisclosed location.   Asadi, 32, says the Afghan government and military he served for more than a decade will see him as a spy for the United States and that the Taliban have been looking to kill him for years because of his identity as a Taliban killer in the skies. Asadi, Rahima and their daughter, Zainab, had been staying in a small room crammed with a bunk bed on Bagram air base, after the Department of Defense and US Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the Department of Homeland Security, approved the Asadis' request to take refuge in America. Asadi's attorney Kimberley Motley says Asadi has a job offer and a place to stay already arranged in the United States. She says someone seems to be playing politics with the Asadis' lives. "The US has an obligation under the UN convention of torture act that if there's a substantial ground for believing that a person would be in danger of being subjected to torture, that we have an obligation as a government to not expel that person," Motley said. "Ultimately we need to be a country of our word."  A Pentagon spokesperson said it is aware of the situation surrounding Asadi, who is still an active-duty officer in the Afghan air force. "There are criteria and processes to handle humanitarian parole requests by foreign nationals," Pentagon spokesperson Army Maj. Rob Lodewick said in a statement. "After completing a full review of the request, the appropriate officials determined that DoD could not support the request. Because this remains a developing situation that involves personal matters and privacy concerns, DoD remains limited in what can be publicly disclosed." Asadi says he has proof that his and his family's lives are being threatened. The threat came in the form of a letter to Asadi's father demanding he turn his son in for killing members of the Taliban. If not, the letter said, the Taliban would seek revenge on the family. 'Persecution'The email was authenticated by a contractor adviser working for the US military's Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict, who wrote: "It is reasonable to infer that the applicant's family face specific persecution from the Taliban."  Asadi had applied to come to the US under a program known as Significant Public Benefit Parole, which offers temporary status for non-US citizens who need protection.In an email Motley provided to CNN, the chief of the Humanitarian Affairs Branch of US Citizen and Immigration Services wrote, "USCIS confirms approval of parole on the basis of DOD evidence related to the direct threat ... please issue parole document and coordinate flight processing." Asadi says he was filled with relief and joy on October 28 when he was told to come pick up his passport and boarding pass at the US Embassy. But a couple of hours before he was supposed to do that, he says, he was told his passport and boarding pass were not ready "due to some issues." A few hours after that, Asadi says, he received a call from the Afghan government demanding that he go to an Afghan air force commander's office to answer questions about why he was leaving the Afghan military. "At that point I knew that he might just jail me. They look at me as a spy now because I was under the protection of the US government," he said. The Afghan Ministry of Defense and the Embassy of Afghanistan in Washington have not yet responded to requests for comment.Asked about the Taliban's threats against Asadi and his worries about the Afghan government, Lodewick said in a statement that "Major Asadi is an officer in good standing with the Afghan Air Force (AAF) and with US Forces - Afghanistan."Lodewick said the Defense Department "continues to work with Afghan leaders to mitigate risks to pilots within the AAF. ... Taliban threats to our Afghan military partners, no matter how common, are not taken lightly by DoD or the Afghan Government. Taliban violence in Afghanistan has been unacceptably high for too long and must decrease for progress towards peace, which all Afghans deserve, to continue." Speaking to CNN before he was forced to leave Bagram Air Base, Asadi told CNN that he was "thankful to be on this base, no matter how small our room. We are at least safe here."Keeping their wordAs he spoke by video call, his wife sat beside him, holding their daughter tightly. Asadi said he knew he wouldn't be safe "if they throw me out. My wife and child will have no one." He can't believe this is happening to him after years of working with the US against the Taliban and ISIS.  In August, he had received a letter of commendation for leading a formation in a risky last-minute mission to protect and save an American Air Force pilot whose aircraft was downed in Afghanistan's heavily contested Baghlan province. The letter, written by US Air Force Capt. Robert V. Yost, said Asadi was "one of our most trusted partners in the MD-530 helicopter community." And that "Asadi's actions were vital to the safe rescue and transport of the US pilot."   Now Asadi says he fears for his life and his family's lives because of the last-minute decision by the US Department of Defense."I am only asking them to keep their word," Asadi said. "I am most afraid of the Taliban, but in this moment right now, I am most afraid of the Afghan government because they don't keep their word."(CNN) - The Justice Department on Monday released a copy of President Donald Trump's pardon of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and formally asked a federal court to dismiss the case against him.Trump's pardon, announced last week, appears to clear Flynn from the crimes he's admitted to and all possible prosecutions in the future that could relate to the investigation the FBI conducted into him, his cooperation during the Mueller investigation and his disclosures about secretly lobbying for Turkey in 2016, the Justice Department said in a filing with Judge Emmet Sullivan.The pardon also appears to excuse Flynn from telling the federal court under oath that he is guilty of his crimes and, later, claiming he is innocent.The pardon absolves Flynn from "any possible future perjury or contempt charge in connection with General Flynn's sworn statements and any other possible future charge that this Court or the court-appointed amicus has suggested might somehow keep this criminal case alive over the government's objection," the Justice Department wrote.(CNN) - Let's try and do this with no spoilers shall we?"The Undoing" is the latest "hurry up and binge it so we can talk about it" limited series and theories abound.Nicole Kidman stars in the HBO thriller (HBO is owned by CNN's parent company) as Grace Fraser, a successful therapist married to oncologist Jonathan (played by Hugh Grant) with whom she shares a young son who attends an elite private school in New York City. "A chasm opens in Grace's seemingly perfect life: a violent death, a missing spouse, and a chain of terrible revelations," is how HBO describes what happens. Kidman hopped on her verified Instagram account stories to share some famous fans theories and comments including rapper Travis Scott, reality star/entrepreneur Kourtney Kardashian and actresses Issa Rae and Kerry Washington. Bravo host and executive Andy Cohen even got in on the conversation.When former Real Housewives of New York cast member Carole Radziwill shared on social media what she thought happened, Kidman reposted it and used as an opportunity to ask Cohen if he thought her character "would make a good Real Housewife." "Grace might be too secretive and bottled up to be a good real housewife!" Cohen wrote on his Instagram story."The Undoing" reunites Kidman with writer David E.

Washington, DC  (CNN) - President-elect Joe Biden has hairline fractures in his "mid-foot" and will "likely require a walking boot for several weeks," his doctor said in a statement Sunday, after Biden slipped while playing with his dog, Major, Saturday."Initial x-rays did not show any obvious fracture, but his clinical exam warranted more detailed imaging," Dr. Kevin O'Connor said Sunday. "Follow-up CT scan confirmed hairline (small) fractures of President-elect Biden's lateral and intermediate cuneiform bones, which are in the mid-foot. It is anticipated that he will likely require a walking boot for several weeks."Earlier Sunday, Biden's office announced he was going to be examined by an orthopedist "out of an abundance of caution" after he twisted his ankle playing with the dog. On Sunday evening, President Donald Trump tweeted, "Get well soon!"Biden, who celebrated his 78th birthday on November 20, is set to be the oldest president in US history. During the campaign, the Biden campaign released a summary of Biden's medical history, which showed the former vice president was healthy and fit for the presidency.The release included the results of a physical exam by O'Connor, Biden's primary care doctor since 2009 and the director of executive medicine at The George Washington Medical Faculty Associates.O'Connor wrote that Biden is "a healthy, vigorous, 77-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency."The Biden family has two dogs, Major and Champ, both German Shepherds.The Bidens fostered Major from the Delaware Humane Association and made his adoption official in November 2018.

(CNN) - Several celebrities attended a birthday bash for actress Reginae Carter on Sunday night at an Atlanta nightclub.Though Covid-19 cases across the country continue to rise and people have been warned to avoid large gatherings, many of the guests were not wearing masks or socially distancing, as seen in video in several posts on social media.The 1990s/2000s themed birthday bash for Carter, daughter of rapper Lil' Wayne, was held at Republic Lounge. According to its website, the lounge is a 7,550 square feet venue in West Midtown.CNN has reached out to the club for comment.On Sunday, the day of the party, a record-high 93,238 Covid-19 patients were hospitalized in the US, according to the Covid Tracking Project. For weeks, health officials urged people to rethink Thanksgiving travel and gatherings to minimize the spread of the virus as the number of cases increase.Meanwhile in Atlanta, a packed party was being held to celebrate Carter's 22nd birthday. It even featured music performances by her father, Lil' Wayne, and fellow hip-hop artists, Juvenile and 2 Chainz. They were all seen in posts at the party without masks and at times standing shoulder to shoulder with each other."The Mayor's advisory mask mandate and orders on gathering remain in effect," a spokesperson for Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told CNN in a statement. "However, State Orders -- which supersede decisions made at the local level -- currently allow bars and venues to remain open."Other celebrities in attendance included music producer and rapper Mannie Fresh, singer-songwriter Kandi Burruss and her husband Todd Tucker. Burruss shared several images and videos on her Instagram from the party. The couple owns restaurants in Atlanta and are cast members on "The Real Housewives of Atlanta." A representative for Burruss and Tucker could not be reached for comment.On social media, Carter posted images along with a thank you to her boyfriend YFN Lucci and those who attended, "I want to thank everybody who came and partied with me! Y'all some real ones," it said.CNN has reached out to representatives for Carter and YFN Lucci for comment."COVID-19 continues to ravage our communities -- disproportionately impacting Black and Brown communities," reads the statement from the mayor's office. "If we are to curb the spread of this deadly disease, we all have an individual responsibility to take every precaution possible to stay safe."Several celebrities have hosted large parties during the pandemic showing guests seemingly ignoring Covid-19 guidelines. Earlier this month, Kendall Jenner faced backlash on social media for her 25th birthday Halloween bash that was held in West Hollywood. President-elect Joe Biden is set to unveil an all-star economic team Tuesday to tackle a darkening winter outlook as the USA struggles to dig out of the worst recession in a century. Analysts expect stiff resistance from a split Congress whose Republicans are reluctant to further swell the massive deficit.At the forefront of Biden's team is former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, his pick for Treasury secretary. Other appointees include Neera Tanden, a former aide to Hillary Clinton and chief executive of the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress, to head the Office of Management and Budget. Cecilia Rouse, dean of the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, has been tapped to lead the Council of Economic Advisers.Save better, spend better: Money tips and advice delivered right to your inbox. Sign up hereBiden deftly chose veteran Washington officials and policymakers left-of-center but not in the "progressive" camp led by Democratic Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, says Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy analyst at Stifel.“They’re some experienced hands at high levels” of government, Gardner says.In contrast to top economic officials in the Trump administration, Biden’s economic team “doesn’t look very corporate, does it?” says Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist who served with Yellen on the Fed’s board in the 1990s.The lineup is likely to push for a more aggressive economic blueprint than the Trump administration sought, including a robust COVID-19 relief package and ambitious proposals to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure, build a clean-energy economy and provide tuition-free community college.  Biden wants to raise taxes on corporations and individuals earning more than $400,000.The spending proposals would add to a deficit that has tripled to a record $3.1 trillion this year. Yellen, as well as the other appointees, have said that with borrowing costs are low and households and businesses suffering, now isn’t the time to whittle down the debt."In the near-term, there is clearly a need for more fiscal aid to act as a bridge to get us through this period," says Maya MacGuineas, head of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.COVID-19 vaccine:Prospects may already be boosting consumer spending, economyBiden's pick for treasury secretary:As Treasury chief, Yellen may be a calming influence in a Washington split over stimulus and everything elseCongress has been deadlocked for months over the relief package. House Democrats approved $2 trillion legislation that would provide more aid to millions of unemployed Americans, struggling small businesses and financially stressed states and cities. Senate Republicans pushed a $500 billion proposal. Two runoff races in Georgia will determine whether Republicans retain control of the Senate.Even if Democrats win both races – giving the party technical control since Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would hold the deciding vote in a split Senate – Biden faces an uphill climb.“It’s going to be a challenge for Yellen to work with the people in the Senate to get things done," says Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who served as managing director and chief emerging market economic strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.A divided Senate means Democrats won’t have close to a filibuster-proof majority of 60 votes. Gardner expects a limited COVID-19 relief measure of $500 billion to $1 trillion early next year, with more aid possible later. He’s not looking for any of Biden’s tax and spending plans to be passed.  Blinder says the center-left troupe may be positioned to haggle with Republicans and push through a more expansive relief plan and some modest tax and spending initiatives. Some tax and spending measures could be tacked onto catch-all budget reconciliation bills, he says.“There’s a chance,” he says.Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, suggests Biden’s more centrist economics team could horse-trade with Republicans on other bills. “You give me something and I’ll give you something,” he says.Gardner says the Biden team's best chance to enact his agenda is through executive actions and regulations. Besides drafting a budget, the Office of Management and Budget includes the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which can temper rules passed by other agencies, Gardner says.Yellen will have a big role in selecting the heads of regulatory agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Fed and the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, Gardner says.The team faces a historic challenge. The economy has recovered about 55% of the 22 million jobs lost in the spring, but monthly payroll gains have steadily slowed since peaking at 4.8 million in June, and recouping the rest could take several years, economists say. More than 130,000 businesses have closed for good, according to estimates by Yelp.The coronavirus has surged to records, and states and localities are reinstating restrictions. Meanwhile, extended unemployment benefits and an eviction moratorium are among the federal aid set o expire at year's end.  J.P Morgan expects economic output to dip early next year, and others say there's a risk the economy slips back into recession. Here’s a look at the economics team:The Treasury Department is central to Biden's plans for stimulating the economy and recovering from the pandemic. Besides collecting taxes, Treasury handles international economic affairs, domestic finance, such as the debt and deficit, and financial crimes.It plays a huge role in formulating economic policy. If confirmed, Yellen would succeed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who led relief negotiations with Congress.Beyond any immediate aid, Biden's economic proposals call for overturning President Donald Trump's tax cuts for corporations and for individuals earning more than $400,000 per year. Biden proposed to spend trillions of dollars to spur manufacturing, develop clean energy and support caregivers. Those proposals all rely on tax hikes that face difficult negotiations with Congress.“If the Biden administration wants to change the tax code or think about debt and deficits, the Treasury secretary is enormously important in that process,” says Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at AEI. ”Yellen would be the first woman to lead the Treasury Department. She was also the first to lead the Fed and served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton.Lachman says the markets reacted favorably to Yellen because of her experience. Yellen, who has advocated for more coronavirus relief to recover from the recession, takes a more moderate approach to keeping deficits under control than a liberal alternative such as Sen. Warren, D-Mass., who supported large increases in spending on health care and education.“She is hugely qualified. She’s a very safe pair of hands,” Lachman says of Yellen. “She’s not on the progressive side of the party. She’s unlikely to go along with things that don’t make economic sense.”Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, says she'll "get a favorable view" in the confirmation process although senators must still consider background documents she'll provide.Yellen is likely to support more coronavirus aid than Mnuchin. Lachman says a bigger change may be abroad, where she is expected to cooperate with international partners, rather than applying tariffs to imports from allies such as Canada and Germany."Her intelligence, tenacity and calm approach make Janet a trailblazer for women everywhere," Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, tweeted in her congratulations to Yellen. "I look forward to tackling yet again the global economic challenges we are facing, together."Yellen served as the Fed's vice chair from 2010 to 2014, after a term on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. She has been a faculty member at the University of California-Berkeley for 40 years after earning a bachelor's degree at Brown University and a doctorate in economics from Yale University.Wally Adeyemo, president of the Obama Foundation, would become the first Black person to serve as deputy secretary of Treasury. During the Obama administration, he served as deputy director of the National Economic Council, deputy national security advisor, as the first chief of staff of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and as deputy chief of staff at Treasury.Before and after his service in the Obama administration, he advised a range of nonprofit and private organizations, including the Center for Strategic & International Studies. Adeyemo, who was born in Nigeria and raised in California, earned a bachelor's degree from the University of California-Berkeley and his law degree from Yale Law School.Tanden would be the first woman and person of Southeast Asian descent to lead the Office of Management and Budget, which not only maps the president's spending blueprint but also serves as a gatekeeper by reviewing government regulations for their financial impact.Tanden was a senior adviser in the Clinton administration, and she worked for Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., before serving as political director for her 2008 presidential campaign. Tanden served as director of domestic policy for President Barack Obama's campaign.Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., tweeted Monday that "Neera Tanden is a big-government, big-spending radical liberal who’s a terrible choice for OMB Director."Drew Brandewie, a spokesman for Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, tweeted Sunday that Tanden has "zero chance of being confirmed" because of disparaging tweets against Republicans.At the Center for American Progress and in previous administrations, Tanden advocated for policies designed to support working families, foster broad-based economic growth and curb inequality. Her family relied on food stamps and Section 8 subsidized housing when she was a child. She earned a bachelor's degree from the University of California-Los Angeles and a law degree from Yale.Rouse, a labor economist at Princeton, would become the first Black person to lead the Council of Economic Advisers after serving on the panel during the Obama administration. She was on the National Economic Council during the Clinton administration.The role of the Council of Economic Advisers varies between administrations. The three-member panel keeps the White House updated on the state of the economy and provides economic analysis of issues such as changing the tax code or rolling out regulations to mitigate climate change.“They will do expert economic analysis to figure out what the effects of the policy changes will be on the economy,” Strain says.He suggests as the economy faces slow growth, declining workforce participation and lackluster education, skills and training systems, Rouse will be in a unique position to keep those items on the White House radar.Rouse's expertise focused on the economics of education and equality. She joined the Princeton faculty in 1992 after receiving a bachelor's degree and a doctorate in economics from Harvard University.Bernstein would become a member of the Council of Economic Advisers. Bernstein served as chief economist to Biden when he was vice president before joining the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities as a senior fellow. He was executive director of the White House task force on the middle class. Bernstein testified in July before the Joint Economic Committee, urging fiscal relief as $600 weekly unemployment payments ended and millions remained jobless. He argued that shortchanging temporary relief over deficit concerns during a period of low interest rates would be "highly misguided.""By working together to quickly implement significant fiscal relief in these and other areas, Congress can once again throw struggling people, places and businesses the lifeline they need to make it to the other side of this crisis," Bernstein said.Bernstein served as a senior economist and director of the Living Standards Program at the Economic Policy Institute and as the deputy chief economist at the Labor Department during the Clinton administration. Bernstein is a former social worker who advocated policies to expand opportunities for working Americans. He earned a bachelor's degree from the Manhattan School of Music, a master's degree in social work from Hunter College and a doctorate in social welfare from Columbia University.Boushey, a longtime economic counselor to Biden, would become a member of the Council of Economic Advisers. Boushey focused on economic inequality as CEO of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, which describes itself as "a nonprofit research and grantmaking organization dedicated to advancing evidence-backed ideas and policies that promote strong, stable and broad-based economic growth."Boushey wrote in the journal Democracy last year that the financial meltdown and Great Recession in 2007 were neither predicted nor solved by traditional economists. She argued that economic inequality is “undermining long-held theories about the so-called natural laws of economics.”Boushey was chief economist for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She served as an economist for the Center for American Progress, the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress, the Center for Economic and Policy Research and the Economic Policy Institute.She received her bachelor's degree from Hampshire College and a doctorate in economics from the New School for Social Research.President-elect Joe Biden is set to unveil his economic team Tuesday as the U.S. struggles to dig out of the worst recession in a century. At the forefront of Biden's team is former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, his pick for Treasury secretary. Other appointees include Neera Tanden, a former aide to Hillary Clinton and chief executive of the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress, to head the Office of Management and Budget. Cecilia Rouse, dean of the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, has been tapped to lead the Council of Economic Advisers. The lineup is likely to push for a more aggressive economic blueprint than the Trump administration, including a robust COVID-19 relief package and proposals to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure, build a clean-energy economy and provide tuition-free community college. Giving Tuesday, an annual day recognized for charitable giving, kickstarts December this year — a month big for donating. Woodrow Rosenbaum, chief data officer for Giving Tuesday, said that giving is up 20% year over year in all categories to both nonprofits and small businesses — despite the decline in the first quarter. "The pandemic is motivating a lot of generosity," he said. "People are finding generosity as an antidote to fear, uncertainty, division." If you are unable to give financially or otherwise this year, Rosenbaum suggested virtual volunteering, letter-writing campaigns and even sidewalk chalk messages as safe options amid the coronavirus pandemic. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel is scheduled to meet Tuesday to vote on how to allocate the first supplies of a COVID-19 vaccine. The meeting on who gets the first doses comes as at least two vaccine makers have filed for emergency use authorization with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. When a vaccine is available, it will be in short supply and rationed by the federal government. Moderna said the FDA's advisory committee will discuss its vaccine on Dec. 17, a week after it meets to discuss Pfizer's vaccine, and authorization is expected is expected to come a few days after each meeting. The White House is going ahead with plans to hold holiday parties and receptions despite warnings from public health officials to avoid large in-person gatherings. An invitation to a reception on Tuesday — a copy of which was obtained by USA TODAY — makes no mention of mandatory face masks or social distancing requirements. But Stephanie Grisham, spokeswoman and chief of staff for first lady Melania Trump, said Monday that masks will be required and that social distancing will be recommended while on White House grounds. “Attending the parties will be a very personal choice,” Grisham said. “It is a longstanding tradition for people to visit and enjoy the cheer and iconic decor of the annual White House Christmas celebrations.”Tuesday – the first day of meteorological winter – will feature a winter storm for portions of the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and Appalachian mountains. As much as a foot of snow is possible in some areas, according to the National Weather Service, mainly in northeastern Ohio, northwestern Pennsylvania and western New York State. In West Virginia, where up to 7 inches is possible, the snow will be a boon to some of the state’s ski resorts that are scheduled to open for the season later this week. Accumulating snow is also expected in the Appalachians as far south as Tennessee, western North Carolina and far northeast Georgia. Nov. 30 (UPI) -- A Texas judge on Monday sentenced an Indian national to 20 years in prison for operating a complex scheme from India-based call centers to defraud Americans of tens of millions of dollars.Patel was also ordered to pay nearly $9 million in restitution to his victims, the Justice Department said.Patel pleaded guilty in January to operating several Indian call centers from where his co-conspirators would call Americans pretending to be officials from the Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and threaten their victims with arrest, fines and deportation if they did not pay money they alleged was owed to the U.S. government.His victims would be instructed to pay their alleged debts through general purpose reloadable cards or through wire transfers and upon payment, a network of runners in the United States would launder the ill-gotten funds, the Justice Department said."The defendant defrauded vulnerable U.S. victims out of tens of millions of dollars by spearheading a conspiracy whose members boldly impersonated federal government officials and preyed on victims' fears of adverse government action," Acting Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department's Criminal Division said in a statement. "Today's sentence demonstrates the department's commitment to prosecuting high-level perpetrators of such nefarious schemes."The United States indicted Patel along with 60 other people and entities in October 2016. Twenty-four defendants in the United States associated with the scheme were convicted and sentenced by courts in Texas, Arizona and Georgia to up to 20 years in prison.He was extradited to the United States the same month of his arrest, prosecutors said."The sentence imposed today provides a clear deterrent to those who would seek to enrich themselves by extorting the most vulnerable in our society through these types of scams," said Special Agent in Charge David Green of the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General. "These foreign call center operators and their U.S. based affiliates should know that their actions carry real-life consequences."Patel's sentencing came more than a month after the Justice Department announced a federal court order against five companies to stop another call center scheme that was the result of the first parallel action by U.S. and Indian governments targeting elder fraud.The scheme consisted of contacting U.S. citizens via Internet pop-messages that falsely purported to be security alerts claiming their computers were infected and directed the victims to call a toll-free number, where conspirators at call centers would ask to be paid hundreds of dollars to remove non-existent issues from their computers.
