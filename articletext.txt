Washington  (CNN) - Even with coronavirus spiking and new restrictions taking effect, Congress remains stalled on fresh relief for Americans in need. While there's support from both Republicans and Democrats for sending out another round of payments, it's unlikely Americans will get a second round of stimulus checks before the end of the year -- and lawmakers have been unable to come to any agreement on a broader economic aid package. Congress returns to Washington this week focused on passing a broader spending bill by December 11 to avert a partial government shutdown, though it's possible that some relief programs could be added to such a broader spending bill.If anything, those provisions may extend programs set to expire on December 31 -- including expanded unemployment benefits, an eviction moratorium and a pause on student loan payments. Disagreements over new checksThere's been little talk from lawmakers of a second round of stimulus checks since the summer. The most recent stimulus package proposal put forth by Republicans, who currently control the Senate, didn't include money for direct payments.President-elect Joe Biden supports a $3 trillion Democratic-backed bill that passed the House in May, which provided for a second round of checks. But that package has little chance of passing Congress unless Democrats gain control of the Senate by winning both runoff Senate races in Georgia set for January 5. More than 160 million Americans received stimulus payments earlier in the year, after Congress approved a $2 trillion aid package in March. They helped keep many families out of poverty as millions of people lost their jobs due to the pandemic.But for many, that $1,200 check has already been spent. Now, as coronavirus cases surge, a group of more than 120 economists are urging lawmakers to approve another round of checks, arguing that they are "one of the quickest, most equitable, and most effective ways to get families and the economy back on track."Congress has already allowed some relief programs to expire, like the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses and the $600 federal boost to weekly unemployment benefits. But others end this month. If Congress adds any stimulus to the general spending bill, they may prioritize pushing back those deadlines. Expanded unemployment benefitsAs part of the historic broadening of jobless benefits under the CARES Act, lawmakers created three programs to help out-of-work Americans. While the $600 payment enhancement lasted only four months, the other two run through the week ending December 26, which is the last weekend of the year.One of them, the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, allows independent contractors, the self-employed and gig workers to qualify for payments. It also opens up the program to those who can't work because of the pandemic, including if they or family members are ill or quarantining or if their children's schools are closed.The other program, called Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, provides an additional 13 weeks of federally paid benefits to those who run out of state payments, which typically last 26 weeks.Student loan payment pauseIn March, the US government automatically suspended payments and waived interest on federal student loans. That meant millions of borrowers could skip making their monthly payments without their balances getting any bigger.Initially, the relief -- which was included in the $2 trillion congressional stimulus package -- was set to expire at the end of September. But President Donald Trump later moved the date to December 31 by an executive action.If neither Trump or Congress acts to push the deadline back, millions of student loan payments will come due a couple of weeks before Biden takes office on January 20. Even if Biden reinstates the pause retroactively, it could create confusion for borrowers as well as a mess for student loan processors, who aren't built to suddenly stop or start payment.Eviction protectionA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention order that went into effect in September temporarily halted evictions through the end of the year. It applies to renters who meet certain income requirements, have experienced significant losses of income and have made their best efforts to find rental assistance and pay their rent.Since the order does not cancel or freeze rent, all of a tenant's back rent will be due January 1 if the moratorium is allowed to expire. Without rent relief or an extension of the protection, many struggling renters will again face eviction.An eviction moratorium established by Congress in March shielded only tenants who receive federal assistance or live in rental properties with federally backed financing. That protection lapsed over the summer.Paid family leaveEarlier in the year, lawmakers expanded paid family leave benefits for many workers who become ill or are caring for someone else.It was limited to employees of companies with fewer than 500 workers but provided up to two weeks of paid sick leave and an additional 10 weeks of paid expanded family leave for parents who need to care for children whose schools closed.However, the payments are capped, and small businesses can apply for waivers from the provisions affecting workers whose children's schools have shut down.Those benefits also are set to expire on December 31.(CNN) - As the US prepares for the first round of vaccinations to tackle Covid-19, infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci called on the public to "be part of the solution" and get vaccinated once it is available. "Say, 'I'm not going to be one of the people that's going to be a steppingstone for the virus to go to somebody else. I'm going to be a dead end to the virus,'" Fauci told Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Monday. The virus has been spreading quickly, and November set records 20 times for the number of coronavirus hospitalizations, according to the Covid Tracking Project, the most recent Monday with 96,039. All the while Johns Hopkins University data reports that the US has reached more than 13.5 million total cases and 268,045 deaths. And the impacts of Thanksgiving travel still won't be felt for weeks, health experts say.Holiday gatherings -- like Thanksgiving and upcoming Christmas and Hanukkah -- are the "perfect setup" for people who have no symptoms to "innocently and inadvertently" spread infections to their loved ones. With that in mind, officials are preparing for the first wave of vaccine distributions. Vaccine candidates from Pfizer and Moderna are both awaiting emergency use authorizations (EUA). States have until Friday to request the number of doses for Pfizer's vaccine, Executive Director of the Association of Immunization Managers Claire Hannan told CNN Monday. Once the US Food and Drug Administration grants EUAs and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention makes recommendations on which groups will get the vaccines first, they will be ready to be shipped out, Dr. Moncef Slaoui, Operation Warp Speed chief scientific adviser, said Monday. And that very day or the next, the first immunizations can be administered, he said.US still battling a surgeBut even after vaccines start to be distributed in December, there won't be enough for the wider public to be immunized until April or May of 2021, Fauci said. Until then, the US is still contending with an unprecedented spike. In Minnesota, more than a third of counties are 10 times over what would be considered a high-risk threshold for infection rate growth as the state is in "the worst spot we've been in since March," Minnesota Department of Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said Monday. "When there's this great increase in the number of Minnesotans needing hospitalization for Covid, that can have some really serious implications for the availability of hospital care for other critical issues as well," Malcolm said. "And the number of people being admitted for Covid is far overshadowing what we saw back in May."To manage the risk of reopening, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced a new "Red to Green" system that tiers counties by their risk of spread. The data will be updated biweekly, and if a county fails to meet the metrics, it will begin operating at the most restrictive level within 48 hours. Nationally, Monday marked the 28th consecutive day that the US reported more than 100,000 new cases -- a number that far exceeds the records set in the spring and summer surges which both stayed below 60,000.Hospitals under stressAs cases increase over the holiday season, so have hospitalizations -- putting health care systems under stress. California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday told reporters that the intensive care unit bed capacity in the state might reach 112% by Christmas Eve, if the trend of surging coronavirus cases continues.In Rhode Island, officials have prepared to use field hospitals after telling residents their systems were already at capacity.In New York, where some hospitals saw room capacity taxed in March, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this time medical systems need to take steps to move patients to other facilities that have space."No patient wants to be in an overwhelmed hospital, because you're getting less care, the staff is stretched thin, it's in the patient's best interest, distribute the patient load over the system," Cuomo said Monday. "We're not going to live through the nightmare of overwhelmed hospitals again."Health care systems might be even more strained this time around because researchers are now seeing people affected by the virus even after they no longer show symptoms, Fauci said. Some, called "long haulers," experience lingering symptoms for months. Others see residual and perhaps indefinite organ system dysfunction, he said."The idea that you get infected, you either get no symptoms or you die, and if you don't die, you're OK -- I think that's really a misperception," he added.Challenges for small communities to get vaccinesHealth care systems already under stress will face another challenge distributing vaccines to rural communities, experts say.Pfizer has planned its vaccine to be in ultracold storage and shipped in thermal shippers that can hold at least 975 and up to 5,000 doses."That's not workable from a small town, rural perspective," Alan Morgan, chief executive officer of the National Rural Health Association, told CNN Monday. "It just isn't."Those doses will have to be broken up among multiple providers in those communities, and they will have to do it without risking the temperature at which they are stored, Hannan said, Immunization managers in those areas are going to have to find solutions like having providers pick up doses from a central location or shipping them out in containers with dry ice, Morgan and Hannan said.If they don't, they risk being sidelined, said Morgan. "That type of approach just sets up these rural communities across the US for really unacceptable mortality rates and the potential for the collapse of the health care system," he said.Pfizer did not have an immediate response questions about the concerns over shipment sizes.New York  (CNN) - Salesforce is buying workplace messaging app Slack for $27.7 billion.Under the terms of the agreement, Slack shareholders will receive $26.79 in cash and 0.776 shares of Salesforce stock per Slack share. Salesforce announced the deal in a statement Tuesday in conjunction with its earnings release for its third quarter of fiscal 2021. The move will allow Salesforce, which sells cloud-based customer relationship management software and other enterprise applications, to bolster its business offerings. The company, launched in 1999, was ranked 240 on Fortune 500's largest US companies by revenue list in 2019.Slack's stock was flat in after hours trading Tuesday. Salesforce shares fell more than 3%. Slack is a workplace communications tool popular among tech companies, media firms and retailers — it is used by Amazon, IBM, TD Ameritrade and others, including CNN. It's been an especially strong year for the company, with its stock up more than 59% since the beginning of 2020, as businesses scrambled to manage remote teams. In June, Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield told CNN there is still uncertainty around its growth, especially as businesses pull back on spending: "Existing customers are using Slack more. Individual users are using Slack at a greater percentage of their day ... But at the same time, when [our customers] feel pain, we feel pain."In its most recent quarterly earnings report in September, the company reported more than 130,000 paid customers, up 30% year-over-year. However, Slack has not turned a profit since its initial public offering last year. The acquisition will position Salesforce and Microsoft, with its Teams chat platform, as closer competitors in the remote collaboration space. Because Teams comes bundled with Microsoft's Office products often used in the workplace, it has seen significant growth as more people work remotely. CEO Satya Nadella said Teams' grew to 75 million active users by the end of April, up from 44 million from mid-March. In October 2019, the last time it reported this specific metric, Slack said it had 12 million active daily users. An acquisition from an enterprise software and services giant like Salesforce could help accelerate its growth even more."Stewart and his team have built one of the most beloved platforms in enterprise software history, with an incredible ecosystem around it," Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a statement. "Together, Salesforce and Slack will shape the future of enterprise software and transform the way everyone works in the all-digital, work-from-anywhere world."Last year, Salesforce acquired data analytics firm Tableau Software for $15.7 billion, to help companies better visualize their data, and previously bought Mulesoft, a software company that connects different systems together, for $6.5 billion.The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of Salesforce's fiscal year 2022, subject to approval by Slack shareholders and regulators. (CNN) - A senior member of the European Parliament from Hungary's ruling Fidesz party has resigned after he admitted to breaching Belgium's coronavirus lockdown to attend a private gathering described by national media as a "sex party."József Szàjer said in a statement that he was "present" at the "private party," where police found about 20 people, including diplomats.According to Sarah Durant, the spokeswoman for the Brussels' public prosecutor's office, police were called to an apartment above a bar in the historic city center at 9:30 p.m. last Friday after neighbors "complained of nighttime noise and potential violations of measures linked to the COVID-19 pandemic."Officers found about 20 people at the apartment, two of whom, aged 43 and 33, claimed diplomatic immunity, Durrant said.During police checks, "a passer-by reported to police that he had seen a man flee down the drainpipe," Durrant explained."The man's hands were bloody. It is possible that he may have been injured while fleeing. Narcotics were found in his backpack. The man was unable to produce any identity documents. He was escorted to his place of residence, where he identified himself on the basis of a diplomatic passport as S.J. (1961)."The prosecutor's office said the 59-year-old Hungarian MEP was being investigated over possession of narcotics. "The procedure is ongoing. Criminal proceedings could only be brought after the waiver of the diplomatic or parliamentary immunity of the above-mentioned persons by the competent authorities."Szàjer has denied taking drugs, and said he "deeply" regretted breaking Covid-19 restrictions. "I offered the police to make an instant test, but they did not do it. According to the police they found an ecstasy pill, but it was not mine, I have no knowledge who and how it (was) placed," he said.The gathering, a few meters (yards) from the Brussels Central Police station, broke Belgium's lockdown restrictions, which include an evening curfew and a cap on indoor gatherings to four people.Official reports were drawn up for those who broke Covid-19 measures. The standard fine for breaking coronavirus restrictions is 250 euros (about $300)."I deeply regret for violating the COVID restrictions, it was irresponsible on my part. I am ready to stand for the fine that occurs," said Szàjer.The politician apologized to his family, colleagues and voters and asked them "to evaluate my misstep on the background of thirty years of devotion and hard work.""The misstep is strictly personal," he added. "I am the only one who owes responsibility for it. I ask everyone not to extend it to my homeland, or to my political community."Szájer is a founding member of Hungary's ruling Fidesz party, led by nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, and also one of the co-authors of the country's controversial constitution in 2010 that defined marriage as being solely between a man and a woman.Recently, Fidesz has expressed anti-gay views and has voiced strong opposition to worldwide rights for women, girls and LGBTQ people.Szájer was the head of the Fidesz delegation in the European Parliament and a sat on the Parliament's foreign affairs committee.(CNN) - David Chang just became the first celebrity to win the top prize in "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" And the chef decided to give it all to a good cause -- he's donating the entire $1 million prize to restaurant workers who have been impacted by the pandemic. In the nail-biting final moments of the episode Sunday, host Jimmy Kimmel watched as the Momofuku founder struggled over the last question. "No (celebrity) has ever gone for it," Kimmel said. "They've all walked away." For his final question, Chang was asked to name the first US president to have electricity in the White House. "This is the most painful, nervous -- this is terrifying," Chang can be heard saying in a clip from the episode. After phoning a friend -- ESPN journalist Mina Kimes -- Chang guessed President Benjamin Harrison, despite admittedly not even knowing whether Harrison was a president. Chang jumped from his chair when he heard the sound of screams, as writer and director Alan Yang presented a gigantic check on stage. Chang had won. "Always wanted to hold a giant check on television," Yang wrote on Twitter, with a photo of him, Chang, Kimmel and the check. "Thanks @MillionaireTV! Asian trivia dream team ftw."Chang had always intended on donating the money to the Southern Smoke Foundation, a crisis relief organization for people in the food and beverage industry. If Chang had decided not to answer the question, he would have walked away with roughly $500,000. Instead, he decided to risk it all for the sake of doubling that donation. "Having a million dollars right now in this moment, is a game changer for many, many families," Chang says in the video clip of the episode. "And yes, half a million is as well -- and I want to say 'No, just take the money!' -- but I'm not." While restaurants and bars were classified by states as essential businesses that could operate on takeout and delivery, many still had to close down during stay-at-home orders. Some businesses found it hard, or economically unfeasible to adopt that model, or had other public health concerns."Since the government won't help out restaurant workers...we have to do what we can to help out," Chang tweeted on Sunday in a thread about winning on the show.He added: "Thank you @alanyang and @minakimes for being so much smarter then me!!! Always good to have friends that did well in school!!The Southern Smoke Foundation, started in 2015 by chef Chris Shepherd, has distributed $4,097,425 to 2,071 people nationwide, according to its website. "To date, Southern Smoke has distributed more than $5.7 million, both directly to people in need via the Emergency Relief Fund and to organizations that represent the needs of people in our industry," the organization says on its website.The organization tweeted the news of Chang's win, exclaiming "WE WON A MILLION DOLLARS!" "I'm so honored that Dave chose Southern Smoke as his charity," Shepherd told CNN. "Now, more than ever, with indoor dining shut down in many parts of the country and temperatures dropping to prohibit outdoor dining, food and beverage industry employees are desperate." Southern Smoke estimates that Chang's donation will help 500 food and beverage workers.Washington  (CNN) - An attorney for the Trump campaign on Monday issued a call for violence against Chris Krebs, a former cybersecurity official who was unceremoniously ousted from his post by President Donald Trump after he rejected the President's unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud.  Joe diGenova, an attorney for Trump's campaign, said during an appearance on "The Howie Carr Show": "Anybody who thinks the election went well, like that idiot Krebs who used to be the head of cybersecurity. That guy is a class A moron. He should be drawn and quartered. Taken out at dawn and shot."A source familiar with Trump's election challenges said diGenova is believed to still be helping Rudy Giuliani, Trump's attorney, in challenging the presidential election results. CNN has reached out to the White House and the Trump campaign for comment. DiGenova and Carr did not immediately response to requests for comment.The remarks from diGenova, though much more extreme than others made by officials in the White House during Trump's time in office, underscore the administration's crusade against whistleblowers and others who have spoken out in opposition during the President's term and refuse to adopt his conspiratorial view of the election.DiGenova's remarks were swiftly condemned on Monday by the Government Accountability Project, a whistleblower group that warned that such threats could have a chilling effect on officials seeking to expose wrongdoing. "Threats like these trigger an avalanche of them. They terrorize other whistleblowers into silence. It's behavior befitting a mob attorney," Louis Clark, the group's executive director and chief executive officer, said in a blistering statement on Monday. Trump announced earlier in November that Krebs would be "terminated" from his job running the cyber arm of the Department of Homeland Security "effective immediately" because Krebs' recent statement -- in which he had rejected Trump's claims of widespread voter fraud -- was "highly inaccurate." CNN reported ahead of Krebs' firing that he had expected the move.The statement from Krebs' agency, along with state and private election officials, had read: "The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history. ... There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised."In the lead-up to the election, Krebs had often quietly disputed the President's repeated false claims about mail-in ballots but went out of his way to not get drawn into criticizing his boss for spreading lies.But in the days that followed, Krebs had adopted a more forceful approach, regularly posting on Twitter -- often with blaring red siren emojis -- fact checks of the claims and conspiracy theories being pushed by Trump, his allies and supporters around the country.Despite states certifying their results and awarding electoral votes to President-elect Joe Biden ahead of the Electoral College meeting on December 14, Trump has not conceded the election. Instead, he has continued to falsely claim that he won.(CNN) - President Barack Obama appeared on Monday's "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" and while promoting his book,"A Promised Land," he admitted to making a major "mistake" while in office. After Colbert asked him, "Did you miss you? Did you ever look at something going on in the news and go, 'You know what this situation needs? A little Barack Obama.'"Obama laughed, saying, "I found the work fascinating," he said. "But I do not miss having to wear a tie every day." Colbert eventually asked the one question we are all wondering. "How does Dolly Parton not have a Presidential Medal of Freedom?" he said. Obama admitted that one was a "screw-up.""That's a mistake -- I'm shocked," Obama replied. "That was a screw-up. I'm surprised. I think I assumed that she had already got one, and that was incorrect."But he added, he will try to fix that. "She deserves one. I'll call Biden," he said."(CNN) - In the month since the presidential election, President Donald Trump has repeatedly argued that Arizona's vote was somehow fraudulent because, uh, he lost."Such total corruption," Trump tweeted Monday as the state's Republican governor, Doug Ducey, certified President-elect Joe Biden's narrow win in the state. "So sad for our country!"Ducey decided to fight back. And he used Trump's favorite medium to do it. In a nine-tweet thread on Twitter, the Arizona governor laid out -- in clear terms -- Arizona's election laws, asserted that those rules were followed and affirmed his faith in the result. (Biden won the state by more than 10,000 votes.)Here's the key bit:"In Arizona, we have some of the strongest election laws in the country, laws that prioritize accountability and clearly lay out procedures for conducting, canvassing, and even contesting the results of an election. We've got ID at the polls. We review EVERY signature (every single one) on early ballots — by hand — unlike other states that use computers. Prohibitions on ballot harvesting. Bipartisan poll observers. Clear deadlines, including no ballots allowed after Election Day."Ducey also noted that in order to delay the certification -- as Trump insisted he should -- specific counties in the state would have to decline to certify their results. "ALL 15 counties in Arizona — counties run by both parties — certified their results," tweeted Ducey. While it is difficult to respond to Trump's allegations -- because they are so incredibly vague by their very nature (We were cheated! Fraud!) -- Ducey does an excellent job of it here. His point is simple: Arizona isn't new to early voting. Its has voter ID, which means that you cannot cast a vote unless you also display a form of identification. There was no evidence of fraud. Therefore, Ducey is simply doing the job the state's Constitution lays out for him.It's a simple -- yet total -- rebuke. And it's all the more effective because it is coming from a governor who long touted his close relationship with Trump.Here's Ducey from this summer:"When there's a need in Arizona I talk to him (Trump) directly. My senior staff knows this. We've had so much outreach, personally, from both the president and the vice president that I had to change the ringtone on my phone. And it rings 'Hail to the Chief' because I didn't want to miss another phone call from the White House to help the state of Arizona."Local 12 News reporter Brahm Resnik caught what seemed to be an incoming call with the "Hail to the Chief" ringtone while Ducey was certifying Arizona's results -- which Ducey declined.And because there is a tweet for everything, here is Trump endorsing Ducey for reelection in 2018:"Governor Doug Ducey of Arizona is doing a great job. It would be really nice to show your support tomorrow by voting for him in Tuesdays Primary. Doug is strong on Crime, the Border, and our Second Amendment. Loves our Military & our Vets. He has my full and complete Endorsement."Trump's decision to turn on Ducey is, of course, not surprising. Trump's allies only remain as such if they are willing to say and do everything he asks. The second they step out of line, he hammers them. (Witness Trump's ongoing savaging of Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who paid more homage to this President than almost any other governor in the country.)What's more surprising and, candidly, refreshing is Ducey's willingness to stand up to Trump's barbs. There has been very little political courage on display among Republicans amid Trump's ongoing attempts to use false claims and conspiracy theories to raise doubts about the election results in the minds of Americans. Ducey, at least, is willing to go public with the fact that Arizona's election was fair -- even if it didn't produce the result he wanted.This is what leadership looks like. More Republicans, especially in Congress, should follow Ducey's lead if they want to preserve the GOP beyond the Trump years.Washington  (CNN) - Sen. Chuck Grassley returned to his Senate office Monday after testing positive for Covid-19 and completing a quarantine earlier this month, and he called on Congress to pass additional coronavirus relief legislation.Grassley, who is 87 and the most senior Republican in the chamber, tested positive for the virus on November 17, but remained asymptomatic throughout his quarantine, the Iowa Republican said in a statement, which said his return was cleared by his doctors."While I continued working from home during my quarantine, I'm glad to be back in the office working for Iowans. During my quarantine, I heard from so many Iowans and Americans across the country. I'm thankful for their prayers and well wishes," Grassley said. "This disease affects people differently. I did not experience symptoms, but more than a thousand Americans are dying every day and many more are hospitalized. That means we all have to do our part to help protect our friends, family and fellow Americans. I will continue to wear a mask and practice social distancing."He continued, "Promising vaccine news means there is light at the end of the tunnel. That makes staying vigilant in the coming months all the more important. Congress must do its part and pass long overdue relief legislation to help families, businesses and communities get through this crisis. I hope my colleagues reach the same conclusion and a bipartisan bill can pass very soon."Grassley, as president pro tempore, is in the presidential line of succession.(CNN) - Covid-19 vaccines are fast approaching, but a second pandemic might impede efforts to recover from the first, according to  the president of a global humanitarian aid group.That second pandemic: "fake news" about those very vaccines.Francesco Rocca, president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said in a virtual briefing to the UN Correspondents Association on Monday that governments and institutions needed to implement measures to combat growing mistrust and misinformation."To beat Covid-19, we also need to defeat the parallel pandemic of mistrust that has consistently hindered our collective response to this disease, and that could undermine our shared ability to vaccinate against it," he said.The leader of the world's largest humanitarian aid network said his organization shares "the sense of relief and optimism" that developments in Covid-19 vaccines bring. But governments and institutions "have to build trust in the communities" where misinformation has taken root, he added.There is growing hesitancy about vaccines around the world, particularly the Covid-19 vaccine, said Rocca. He cited a study by Johns Hopkins University in 67 countries, which found that vaccine acceptance had declined significantly between July and October of this year.Distrust is also growing around other health measuresAt the same time, distrust is growing around other public health interventions that must continue during the pandemic."This high level of mistrust has been evident since the very beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and have clearly facilitated transmission of the virus at all levels," he said. The most obvious example, he added, was how many people in the Western world were unwilling to wear face masks. Still, he said, distrust and misinformation is a global issue."This is not just an issue of mistrust. It is an issue of information," Rocca said. "Surprising as it may seem, there are still communities around the world that are not aware of the pandemic."Such communities are typically vulnerable and marginalized, living outside the reach of typical communication channels, he said. He gave the example of Pakistan, citing a federation survey that found 10% of respondents didn't know about Covid-19. "We believe that the massive coordinated effort that will be needed to roll out the Covid vaccine in an equitable manner, needs to be paralleled by equally massive efforts to proactively build and protect trust," Rocca said.Rocca's comments echoed the words of scientists across the world. Last month, British scientists warned that the United Kingdom may not meet the threshold of vaccine uptake to protect the community because of misinformation, mistrust and public hesitancy to take a coronavirus vaccine.(CNN) - White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is scheduled to meet with Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn in the West Wing Tuesday, as President Donald Trump has privately demanded to know why the agency hasn't granted emergency use for Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine yet, according to two sources. Meadows summed Hahn for a progress update over the weekend. Hahn requested their meeting happen over the phone, one source said, but was told by the White House that the chief of staff preferred to meet in person. That appears to have led to concern within the FDA that the meeting could become tense, leading Hahn to issue a statement to Axios Monday night defending the FDA's timeline. "Let me be clear -- our career scientists have to make the decision and they will take the time that's needed to make the right call on this important decision," Hahn said in the statement.A person familiar with the meeting tells CNN that Hahn is prepared to explain to the President's team that the decision about granting the emergency use authorization is not up to him. The review is conducted by career scientists and not a decision he makes on his own.Pfizer applied for the emergency use authorization November 20. Emergency use authorization from the FDA is not the same as full approval but allows products to be used under particular circumstances before all the evidence is available for approval, according to previous CNN reporting. The FDA has previously said it has scheduled a meeting of its outside advisory panel to discuss Pfizer and BioNTech's application for emergency use authorization for a coronavirus vaccine for December 10.But Trump has become privately frustrated over how long the process is taking, sources told CNN. He has proudly and publicly admitted to pressuring the FDA to move faster. "It could have taken four or five years to do this," Trump told reporters about vaccine progress on Thanksgiving. "Normally, it probably would have taken four or five years, just getting it through the FDA. We pushed it very hard."Amid complaints from the President that the FDA is working too slowly, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Fox News Tuesday that the agency is working "around the clock" but said Trump "will never apologize for putting the fire under these agencies.""We want a safe vaccine, absolutely. We also want a fast one because lives are at stake and a vaccine by the end of the year is key and paramount," McEnany said. It's not clear how the meeting between Meadows and Hahn will go until it takes place. A sense of distrust between Trump's closest advisers and career scientists on the FDA already existed before the FDA issued public statements about the meeting Monday night. "The FDA has been preparing for the review of EUAs for Covid-19 vaccines for several months and stands ready to do so as soon as an EUA request is submitted," Hahn said in a statement shortly after Pfizer applied for emergency use authorization for the vaccine in late November. "While we cannot predict how long the FDA's review will take, the FDA will review the request as expeditiously as possible, while still doing so in a thorough and science-based manner, so that we can help make available a vaccine that the American people deserve as soon as possible."(CNN) - Democrat Mark Kelly will be sworn in on Wednesday as Arizona's junior US senator, finishing the final two years of the term won by the late Sen. John McCain in 2016. Both President-elect Joe Biden and Kelly were certified as the winners of their respective Arizona races on Monday. Their victories make it clear that Arizona is no longer a red state. The state that gave us celebrated Republicans Barry Goldwater and McCain is now a purple state in every sense of the phrase. Both victories followed that of Kyrsten Sinema in 2018. She became the first Democrat to win a Senate race in the Grand Canyon State since 1988. One win could be a fluke; two is a trend. Indeed, you have to go back before most of us were born to find a time when Democrats controlled both Senate seats in Arizona. It last occurred after Carl Hayden was reelected in 1950. That lasted just two years, since Senate Majority Leader Ernest McFarland was defeated by Goldwater in 1952. From that point nearly 70 years ago until Wednesday, Republicans held at least one of Arizona's two US Senate seats.The swing in Arizona's political allegiances can be seen well in the contrast between the 2012 and 2020 Arizona US Senate elections. Both races were held in similar political environments. Democrats won the presidential race by about 4 points nationally in each year. House Democratic candidates outpaced House Republican candidates by less than 3 points in both years. And both the 2012 and 2020 Arizona US Senate races featured no elected incumbents. The outcomes in the 2012 and 2020 races were different, however. Kelly took his race by a little over 2 points. In 2012, Republican Jeff Flake won by 3 points. The presidential results were even more different, despite the similar national environments. Biden, a Democrat, scored a 0.3 point victory in Arizona this year. Republican Mitt Romney won Arizona by 9 points in 2012. That's about a 9-point jump to the left, even as the Democrats won the national popular vote by about 4 points each time.In fact, Republican presidential candidates won Arizona by between about 8.5 points and 10.5 points from 2004 to 2012. Biden became the first Democrat to win the presidential race in Arizona since Bill Clinton in 1996. His 49% was the largest vote share for any Democrat in the state since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. The about 4-point difference between the national vote (Biden by about 4 points) and Arizona's vote (Biden by 0.3 points) is the best for a Democrat since 1948, when Harry Truman won.The movement left has been rather sharp in Arizona. It's one of fewer than 10 states where the Democrats have improved relative to the national vote in each of the last three elections. That shift to the left in Arizona can also be seen on the House level. Democrats hold the same number of seats (five) after the 2020 election as they did after the 2012 election. The percentage of votes won by Democrats, however, has gone way up. Arizona Democratic and Republican House candidates basically received the same percentage of votes in 2020. (Republicans got about 0.3 point more.) In 2012, Republican candidates for the US House in Arizona easily got more votes. Totaling up each district, Republicans won the statewide House vote by about 8.5 points. That equates to a significant shift of about 8 points to the left since 2012. More amazingly, Republicans actually didn't have a candidate running in the state's 7th District in 2012. Had they had one, they probably would have beaten the Democrats by closer to 10 points statewide. The question going forward is whether Arizona will continue its march to the left and become a blue state, like Virginia has over the last decade, or whether Republicans hold their ground or even gain some back in the next few elections. If it's the former, it couldn't have come at a more needed time for Democrats. Republicans have been outperforming their national margins in the Electoral College the last few cycles. Arizona going blue could help balance that out.(CNN) - The instrument platform of the 305-meter telescope at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico collapsed overnight, according to the National Science Foundation. It's a final blow to one of the most powerful telescopes on Earth that has aided astronomical discoveries for 57 years and withstood hurricanes, earthquakes and tropical storms.The collapse occurred just weeks after NSF announced that the telescope would be decommissioned and disassembled through a controlled demolition after sustaining irreparable damage earlier this year. "The instrument platform of the 305m telescope at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico fell overnight. No injuries were reported. NSF is working with stakeholders to assess the situation. Our top priority is maintaining safety. NSF will release more details when they are confirmed," according to a tweet by the National Science Foundation."NSF is saddened by this development. As we move forward, we will be looking for ways to assist the scientific community and maintain our strong relationship with the people of Puerto Rico," the foundation said in another tweet. The spherical radio/radar telescope includes a radio dish 1,000 feet across and a 900-ton instrument platform suspended 450 feet above it. Cables connected to three towers hold the telescope in place. An auxiliary cable came loose from a socket on one of the towers in August, creating a 100-foot gash in the dish. Engineers were assessing and working on a plan to repair the damage when another main cable on the tower broke on November 6.When it broke, the cable crashed into the reflector dish below, causing additional damage. After the break on November 6, engineers inspected the rest of the cables and discovered new breaks as well as slippage from some of the sockets on the towers. Multiple engineering companies reviewed the damage. They determined that the telescope could collapse because it is "in danger of catastrophic failure" and the cables were weaker than expected. The latest review revealed that damage to the telescope could not be stabilized without risking staff and the construction team. This led to the NSF making the decision to decommission the telescope after 57 years. "We believe the structure will collapse in the near future if left untouched," according to a letter by engineering firm Thornton Tomasetti that assessed the observatory ahead of the decommissioning announcement on November 19. "Controlled demolition, designed with a specific collapse sequence determined and implemented with the use of explosives, will reduce the uncertainty and danger associated with collapse."The firm also recommended that this be carried out "as soon as pragmatically possible."Those plans were underway when the telescope collapsed.The NSF had planned to preserve as much of the observatory as it could to allow the observatory to serve as a hub for research and education in the future, as well as restoring operations at the observatory. There is no word yet on how this collapse impacts those plans or if they were able to migrate all of the archival data collected by the telescope to offsite servers.Of interest is the LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) geospace research facility, the visitor center and the offsite Culebra facility for analyzing precipitation and cloud cover data.A legacy of discoveriesOver the years, Arecibo Observatory has revealed new details about our planet's ionosphere, the solar system and worlds beyond it. The telescope has supported and contributed to important discoveries in radio astronomy as well as planetary and solar system research, including gravitational waves. The Arecibo telescope played a key role in discovering the first planet outside our solar system and has helped astronomers identify potentially hazardous asteroids en route to Earth. Observations made by the telescope helped discover the first binary pulsar in 1974 (which led to the 1993 Nobel Prize in physics), supported NASA's Viking mission, produced the first radar maps of Venus' surface and spotted the first exoplanet in 1992. More recently, Arecibo detected organic molecules in a distant galaxy and discovered the first repeating fast radio burst.The observatory, which was featured in the James Bond film "GoldenEye," was completed in 1963 and has been helmed by the NSF since 1970. It is operated and managed by a team at the University of Central Florida, the Universidad Ana G. Méndez and Yang Enterprises Inc. The observatory is so beloved and critical to science, there was even a Change.org petition to save the observatory after the decommissioning was announced. It had more than 35,000 signatures."Arecibo has been an incredibly productive facility for nearly 60 years," said Jonathan Lunine, the David C. Duncan Professor in the Physical Sciences, and chair of the Department of Astronomy at Cornell University, in a statement after the decommissioning was announced. The telescope was designed and constructed by Cornell."For the Cornell scientists and engineers who took a daring dream and realized it, for the scientists who made new discoveries with this uniquely powerful radio telescope and planetary radar, and for all the young people who were inspired to become scientists by the sight of this enormous telescope in the middle of the island of Puerto Rico, Arecibo's end is an inestimable loss." Scientists worry about projects that were in progress using the Arecibo telescope, as well as what it means for future detections -- especially of asteroids that come near Earth. After the decommissioning was announced, NASA made a statement."The planetary radar capability at Arecibo, funded by NASA's Near-Earth Object (NEO) Observations Program, has served as one of two major planetary radar capabilities. It has allowed NASA to fully characterize the precise orbits, sizes, and shapes of some NEOs passing within radar range after they are discovered by wide-field optical telescope survey projects."But NASA's fully operational Goldstone Observatory in California will also be able to characterize these objects, "so NASA's NEO search efforts are not impacted by the planned decommissioning of Arecibo's 305m radio telescope."(CNN) - During Monday night's episode of "The Voice," host Carson Daly announced that contestant Ryan Gallagher would no longer be part of the singing competition show.Daly did not cite a reason, only stating Gallagher "had to exit the competition."Gallagher was part of Kelly Clarkson's team.The former contestant took to his Instagram stories to tell fans that the reason for his departure was not family related, after having recently shared that his mother was hospitalized for Covid-19."Thank you everybody for your concern for my family.

(CNN) - The silence of congressional Republican leaders as President Donald Trump's unfounded claims of election fraud grow wilder and more venomous increasingly resembles the party's deference to Sen. Joe McCarthy during the worst excesses of his anti-Communist crusade in the early 1950s.In McCarthy's era, most of the GOP's leaders found excuses to avoid challenging conspiracy theories that they knew to be implausible, even as evidence of their costs to the nation steadily mounted. For years, despite their private doubts about his charges and methods alike, the top GOP leadership -- particularly Senate Republican leader Robert A. Taft, the Mitch McConnell of his day -- either passively abetted or actively supported McCarthy's scattershot claims of treason and Communist infiltration. A significant faction of Senate Republicans didn't join with Democrats to curb McCarthy's power until the senator immolated himself with his accusations, in highly publicized 1953 and 1954 hearings, that the Army was riddled with Communists during the presidency of fellow Republican Dwight Eisenhower.In many respects, the congressional GOP response to Trump has paralleled the party's response to McCarthy. Whatever their private concerns about Trump's behavior or values, the vast majority of congressional Republicans have supported Trump since his 2017 inauguration at almost every turn, brushing aside concerns about everything from openly racist language to his efforts to extort the government of Ukraine to manufacture dirt on the eventual Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden.That pattern of deference has continued since the election as Trump has raised unfounded claims that he lost only because of massive voter fraud; as an array of state and federal courts have rejected those claims as lacking any supporting evidence, Trump has only heightened his allegations.In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Trump broadened his claims to suggest that the FBI and Department of Justice were part of a plot to defeat him; after weeks of excoriating Georgia's Republican secretary of state for failing to overturn the state's election results on his behalf, Trump this week extended his criticism to the state's staunchly conservative Republican governor, Brian Kemp. On Monday, Trump added a new Republican target when he fired a volley of attacks against Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey after the state certified Biden's victory there.Through it all, as Trump's charges have grown more and more untethered and vitriolic, Senate Majority Leader McConnell, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and other top GOP legislators in both chambers -- not to mention the vast majority of Republican governors -- have raised not a peep of dissent."For me it's the dog that hasn't barked," conservative strategist and Trump critic Bill Kristol says of the party's silence about the President's unfounded fraud claims. "This is as if we've had the Army-McCarthy hearings and everyone is just quiet. No one is rethinking anything."It took years for the GOP to unshackle itself from McCarthy, and even then the separation came only after a figure as formidable as Eisenhower, a sitting President and national hero, privately encouraged it. As Kristol notes, with McConnell and other GOP leaders deferring to Trump so completely -- and many in the GOP breathing a sigh of relief over the party's surprisingly competitive performance in the House and Senate elections -- it's not clear where a critical mass of resistance to him might develop, despite his increasingly open attacks on basic pillars of American democracy."It was easier to get beyond McCarthy than it will be to get beyond Trump," Kristol predicts.If anything, today's congressional Republicans have surrendered even more abjectly to Trump's feverish claims than their predecessors did to McCarthy's. While Taft always supported McCarthy in public, a defiant minority of Republicans confronted him in ways that have been matched today mostly by the unelected Republicans who identify as "never Trumpers."The birth of McCarthyismMcCarthy was first elected to the Senate from Wisconsin in 1946, part of a Republican surge that year fueled by dissatisfaction with the transition back to a peacetime economy after World War II. From that first campaign on, he frequently tarred any force that stood in his way -- from liberal Wisconsin newspapers to the Democrats nominated against him -- as sympathetic, or fully allied, with Communists. "This Communist infiltration is a vital issue in America," he insisted in one radio broadcast during that race, according to Thomas C. Reeves' comprehensive 1982 biography, "The Life and Times of Joe McCarthy."These allegations didn't make McCarthy unique at the time. As the Cold War began in Europe and China fell to Mao Zedong's Communist forces, a wide array of Republicans and conservative Democrats raised alarms about alleged Communist infiltration through a broad range of American institutions; the 1947 hearings by the House Un-American Activities Committee led to the film industry's blacklist of actual and suspected Communists in Hollywood.McCarthy pushed himself to the head of this parade with a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, on February 9, 1950, in which he claimed to hold a list of 205 "active members of the Communist Party" in the State Department. At other points, he changed the number of alleged Communists to 57, but the speech set the pattern for the next four years of his fierce reign: sweeping and shifting accusations, the immediate deployment of new charges anytime one was disproved and the constant allegation that his critics were advancing (either knowingly or unwittingly) the Communist cause. In many respects, McCarthy's rhetorical style prefigured Trump's. Like Trump today, McCarthy constantly tried to fan resentment against allegedly soft and un-American elites, what he called "bright young men who are born with silver spoons in their mouths." Just as Trump has repeatedly encouraged violence from his supporters, McCarthy presented himself as the "manly" alternative to his critics: "McCarthyism," he often declared, "is Americanism with its sleeves rolled up." McCarthy, like Trump, singled out reporters by name for attacks during his speeches. And, like Trump today, McCarthy insisted that his supporters alone represented the "real Americans." (Roy Cohn, the feral attorney who was McCarthy's chief Senate aide and decades later a legal adviser to Trump, provided a living link between the two men.)Many Republicans from the outset recognized the irresponsibility of McCarthy's endlessly mutating accusations. Taft, the longtime GOP Senate leader, son of a former president (William Howard Taft) and a figure so revered in the party that he was known as "Mr. Republican," privately expressed doubts about McCarthy early on. As author Larry Tye recounts in "Demagogue," his 2020 book on McCarthy, after the Wheeling speech Taft privately called the senator "perfectly reckless" and complained he had "made allegations which are impossible to prove" and "may be embarrassing before we get through."But in public, Taft almost always defended and encouraged McCarthy. Though he later denied it, most historians agree that early on he told McCarthy to "keep talking and if one case doesn't work out he should proceed with another." When Harry Truman criticized McCarthy's widening allegations in a speech to the American Legion, Taft called the President "hysterical."Almost from the start, a larger group of congressional Republicans resisted McCarthy's wild charges than have pushed back against Trump at any point in his presidency (and certainly since the 2020 election). On June 1, 1950, first-term Sen. Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, in a statement joined by about half a dozen other GOP colleagues, took to the Senate floor to denounce not only McCarthy but also others in the party who hoped to ride "to victory through the selfish political exploitation of fear, bigotry, ignorance, and intolerance." Even Time magazine, a media pillar of the anti-Communist coalition, by fall 1951 put the senator on its cover under the title "Demagogue McCarthy," according to Reeves.Yet the GOP leadership remained steadfast behind McCarthy in the first years of his rampage. During an extended Senate investigation of his initial accusations in Wheeling against the State Department, wrote Reeves, "Republicans rallied behind McCarthy even though most understood that his allegations were fraudulent." Whatever their private doubts about his claims, Taft and other GOP leaders concluded that McCarthyism was a political winner for the party, a belief reinforced by the GOP's gains in both the House and Senate in the 1950 midterm elections, and the further gains that swept the party to control of both legislative chambers in Eisenhower's 1952 landslide. Gallup polls showed that about three-fifths of Republican voters viewed McCarthy favorably well into early 1954.The bill comes dueIn another parallel to Trump, congressional Republicans were deferential not only because they considered McCarthy an ally, but also because they recognized him as a potential threat. The journalist William S. White captured their skittish ambivalence when he wrote, "In McCarthy, embarrassed Republican leaders know they have got hold of a red-hot bazooka, useful in destroying the enemy but also quite likely to blister the hands of the forces that employ it. Their private fear is that a lethal rocket may at any moment blast out through the wrong end of the pipe."Just like congressional Republicans now with Trump, GOP legislators then found themselves following McCarthy into deeper and deeper waters of conspiracy theories. An early indication of how far McCarthy might go came in June 1951, when he delivered a 60,000-word attack on George Marshall, the brilliant Army chief of staff in World War II and later secretary of state for Truman. It was in that speech that McCarthy famously (or infamously) declared that he was unraveling "a conspiracy ... so immense as to dwarf any previous such venture in the history of man."Yet even after that unhinged attack -- the equivalent at the time, perhaps, of the chimerical claims by Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and other Trump attorneys in their mid-November news conference -- McCarthy was honored with a prime speaking slot at the GOP convention the next summer. And even Eisenhower was intimidated enough by the senator's power to eliminate a passage from his speech defending Marshall when he campaigned in Wisconsin during the presidential race the next year.Like today's GOP with Trump, Republicans then thought they could benefit from McCarthy's bark without feeling his bite. But the bill came due for years of enabling McCarthy after Eisenhower took office in January 1953. Congressional Republicans who had expediently welcomed McCarthy's attacks on Truman's administration found themselves caught in the crossfire as the senator targeted Eisenhower's. Throughout Eisenhower's first two years, McCarthy continued to allege Communist infiltration in the Voice of America, the CIA and eventually -- in the cause that ultimately doomed him -- the Army.Even then, GOP opposition to McCarthy coalesced only slowly. Taft's death in 1953 eliminated a critical McCarthy defender. But Republican leaders like William Knowland of California, Taft's successor, vacillated between defending McCarthy and trying to restrain him. And though Eisenhower consistently resisted a full-scale public confrontation with McCarthy -- and Vice President Richard Nixon repeatedly tried to broker peace between the two -- the breach inexorably widened, with McCarthy more openly attacking the President and Eisenhower more quietly supporting moves against the senator.As McCarthy's conduct became more indefensible, Republican Sen. Ralph Flanders of Vermont -- a leader in what might have been called the "Never-McCarthys" of the day -- publicly acknowledged what so few in his party would say: "The responsibility for this thing lies squarely on the heads of the Republicans who have been obsessed with the value of McCarthy to the party. We are reaping what they have sown."Parallels with TrumpUltimately, McCarthy was destroyed by his overreach in the Army investigation, which snapped back at him when the Defense Department produced detailed evidence that Cohn, his top aide, had systematically pressured the Pentagon to ensure favored treatment for another McCarthy staffer who had been drafted into the Army. The national fever that McCarthy had ignited over four years earlier seemed to break in a single cinematic moment in June 1954 when Joseph Welch, the Army's patrician special counsel, defended yet another young man accused of Communist sympathies by McCarthy with the immortal rejoinder, "Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last?"McCarthy's influence rapidly declined after that. That December, the Senate, which had conducted numerous investigations of McCarthy's behavior, finally voted to censure him. (Even then, Republicans divided exactly in half between support and opposition of the measure.) His influence further receded when Democrats, after picking up seats in the 1954 election, regained control of the Senate, pushing McCarthy into the minority. Embittered, isolated and ravaged by alcoholism, McCarthy died in April 1957.McCarthy didn't create the "red scare" of the early 1950s, but he magnified and intensified it. In the same way, Trump didn't create the anxiety about demographic, cultural and economic change that's at the core of his political movement, but he has sharpened those fears into a powerful political weapon. Each man stirred enormous excitement in parts of the GOP coalition -- particularly working-class voters without college degrees -- and intimidated into silence most of the Republican elected officials who feared his divisive impact on the party and the country.Reeves reports in his biography that while McCarthy was still riding high in early 1954, Walter Lippmann, the most influential newspaper columnist of his time, wrote that the senator's goal was to establish himself as the GOP's "supreme boss." Wrote Lippmann, "This is the totalitarianism of the man: his cold, calculated, sustained and ruthless effort to make himself feared. That is why he has been staging a series of demonstrations, each designed to show that he respects nobody, no office, and no institution in the land, and that everyone at whom he growls will run away."Each of those words could apply as well to Trump and the GOP today. The cowering silence of McConnell and almost all other leading Republicans as Trump expands his illusory fraud charges to a "conspiracy ... so immense" that it encompasses the Justice Department, the FBI and Georgia's Republican governor shows how much the outgoing President has succeeded in silencing dissent across the party. Some Republicans may fear Trump; others may find his fraud accusations a useful tool for weakening Biden or justifying a new wave of voter suppression measures. But whatever their motivation for enabling Trump's baseless and corrosive claims, Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy and the vast majority of other Republican legislators are likely consigning themselves to the same withering verdict that history has applied to the party predecessors who found their own reasons not to object as Joe McCarthy tore for years at the nation's deepest values.(CNN) - The federal government must take "urgent actions" in its response to the coronavirus pandemic, a new report from the US Government Accountability Office finds.Medical supply shortages persist, despite efforts by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to mitigate shortages and expand the supply chain, the report found.States and US territories are concerned about ongoing shortages of some Covid-19 testing materials and medical supplies, including rapid point-of-care tests and reagents needed for testing and nitrile gloves, an October GAO survey found. About one-third of states that responded said they were "greatly" or "completely" concerned about having enough vaccine-related supplies to administer a potential Covid-19 vaccine, and another 21 states said they were "moderately concerned."The GAO made recommendations to HHS and FEMA in September, but they have not been implemented."In light of the surge in COVID-19 cases, along with reported shortages, including GAO's nationwide survey findings, GAO underscores the critical imperative for HHS and FEMA to implement GAO's September 2020 recommendations," the GAO, an independent agency that serves as the investigative arm of Congress, said in its report.In a response attached to the GAO's report, Sarah Arbes, the HHS assistant secretary for legislation, said the agency "does not concur" with the findings about shortages and suggested the report is "too vague" in its recommendations about how best to help states meet testing and supply needs.The new report is also concerned about the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's changes in testing strategy and guidance, saying the CDC has not been transparent about the changes."GAO recommends that HHS ensure that CDC clearly discloses the scientific rationale for any change to testing guidelines at the time the change is made," the report said.The GAO report made 11 recommendations for improving the federal pandemic response. It recommended that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services quickly develop a plan to respond to 27 recommendations in the Coronavirus Commission on Safety and Quality in Nursing Homes analysis, a report released on September 16.The GAO report also recommended that the Department of Veterans Affairs develop a plan to inspect state veterans homes and "collect timely data on COVID-19 cases and deaths in each state's veterans homes."Editor's Note: Michael J.

The views expressed in this opinion are his own.(CNN) - When President-elect Joe Biden assumes office in January, he will face economic challenges that are arguably greater than any president has dealt with since Franklin Delano Roosevelt.Since January, nearly one in seven Americans have lost full-time work. Permanent job losses have erased almost seven years of gains, and the nature of today's unemployment exposes some of our most vulnerable citizens to the worst economic hardships. All of this comes against the backdrop of a rapidly surging Covid-19 pandemic.As 2020 draws to a close, we say goodbye to the worst year for our economy since the Great Depression.However, all the news is not bad news.There are no obvious financial bubbles, and given the stock market expansion, consumers and investors appear confident about the long run. Meanwhile, American household savings are substantially better than a year ago. Moreover, the end of the pandemic could unleash strong economic growth from pent up demand. And the news about vaccine development provides more certainty about the end date of the pandemic.Still, the short-term economic damage from the pandemic will likely persist for several more years. And the long-term damage, particularly to children and young adults, may last for decades. Because of this, Covid-19 relief should be the first economic policy priority of the Biden administration.The next round of Covid relief must accomplish two things. First, it must extend the supplemental pandemic unemployment insurance that has sustained more than 10 million families since March. Second, the bill must provide support to state and local governments that face catastrophic revenue shortfalls well into 2022.Failure to replace state and local government tax losses will have damaging effects, deepening the downturn and potentially adding years to a full recovery. The scope of tax losses could mean layoffs of teachers, firefighters and police across much of the nation.In fact, since January, approximately 1 million local government employees have already lost their jobs. But it also means significant reductions in public services next year.  Education and health care, which comprise more than half of state and local budgets, will be hard hit, but summer 2021 may also see public pools and parks remain closed as municipal and state governments struggle to balance budgets. The House passed a version of pandemic relief with a $2.2 trillion estimated cost in the spring. That eye-popping figure is obviously a starting point for budget reconciliation, but with potential vaccine availability limiting the impact of this disease next year, a more modestly funded compromise between the House and Senate may be possible.While GOP resistance to this size of relief has been characterized as a bailout to poorly run states, that rhetoric is simply wrong. Estimates of fiscal shortfalls produced by Ball State University's Center for Business and Economic Research calculate that California will remain solvent long after Indiana, Missouri and Arkansas have exhausted their rainy-day funds. As Moody's Analytics concluded in a recent report, the economic distress facing states is caused by the fallout of Covid, not fiscal mismanagement.The current CARES Act provided the Payroll Protection Plan (PPP), designed to forestall business layoffs, as well as extend benefits for Covid-related unemployment. But the CARES Act ends in December, and even a modestly better functioning federal government would be working toward a quick compromise. But we face the pandemic with the government we have, not the government we wished we had. So, a new relief bill should provide a good working example of compromise for the next administration. And though such a bill seems increasingly unlikely in the short term, it is incredibly important because there are other urgent priorities that require bipartisan cooperation.Infrastructure week has become a running joke on social media, yet there are few issues that have as much cross-party support as upgrading America's aging infrastructure.Most large American cities face significant congestion problems, and few roads have the necessary technology to accommodate smart vehicles. Meanwhile, many local governments struggle to maintain or improve their water and sewage systems, threatening human and environmental health. And then there are the necessary upgrades to flood and fire control measures, which have become increasingly necessary in light of climate change.The Biden infrastructure plan calls for $2 trillion of spending. This is more than earlier transit plans, but not out of range of all federal infrastructure spending over a typical five to seven year spending plan. Disagreement in Congress often arises when members discuss the scope of spending, rather than its size. That makes infrastructure ripe for early and significant efforts to improve the spirit of compromise.  There is also substantial overlap between parts of the Green New Deal and infrastructure spending that would boost business productivity. For example, investments in smart transportation systems, which is a priority of both progressives and fiscal conservatives, could be claimed by both the Chamber of Commerce and environmentalists as major political victories.Many investments could also reduce costs for local governments with more energy efficient buildings and lower transportation costs. Again, this should appeal to a broad political constituency, easing the path to congressional compromise and setting the stage for future cooperation.After Covid and infrastructure, the hard work begins. Following the pandemic, the United States will face record debt and deepened economic inequality between people and places. We still have rapidly rising health care spending, a counterproductive trade war that weakened US manufacturing and comprehensive immigration reform to contend with. We need longer term paths to constructive compromise.Over the past few decades, the United States has moved away from federalism, where state and local government take a more active role in determining their own best course of action on many of our most divisive issues. This weakens our ability to craft compromises.Increased federalism allows state and local governments to more boldly experiment with spending and regulatory changes, easing many of the stickiest political impasses, while allowing the laboratory of the states to experiment with policies.  We are too diverse a nation to find easy one-size-fits-all solutions. There are good examples of the benefits of federalism. For example, the durability of the Affordable Care Act rests heavily on its state level flexibility in allowing co-payments and incentives for healthy behaviors that make its costs more palatable to taxpayers. Even then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence adopted its Medicaid expansion provisions because they fit easily into the state's existing Healthy Indiana Plan. President-elect Biden faces an historically weakened economy and strengthening pandemic. He also steps into office in an age of deep political distrust. As he fights the economic fallout of Covid, he has a rare chance to resurrect the mechanisms of compromise that have served the United States well for 244 years.Washington  (CNN) - Joe Biden's transition team is bracing for a tough Senate confirmation battle for the President-elect's nominee to lead the Office of Management and Budget, who is already facing fierce opposition from Senate Republicans. Neera Tanden, the CEO and president of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, was announced on Monday as Biden's choice for the position. Biden has announced several Cabinet and other top administration officials, but none have received the same level of backlash as Tanden, who has frequently sparred with Republicans and the progressive wing of the Democratic Party on Twitter.The Biden team is well aware Tanden is a challenging nominee, with one person familiar with the matter telling CNN that there is currently widespread acknowledgment in the Biden transition world that she is going to be tough, at best, to get through the Senate confirmation process.Her uphill battle in the Senate was underscored Monday by a wave of criticism aimed at her from Republican senators. Republicans currently hold a majority in the Senate, but two January runoff elections in Georgia will determine which party controls the chamber and could affect the confirmation process. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said that Tanden has a "problematic path" to confirmation in light of past "combative and insulting comments" about GOP senators. Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton said Tanden's tweets are "Filled with hate & guided by the woke left" and tweeted, "she's unfit to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate."South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who is expected to chair the Budget Committee if Republicans keep control of the Senate, said the Tanden nomination faces an "uphill" climb in the Senate. There are plenty of other Biden nominees, including Janet Yellen for treasury secretary, who have received fine reception from both Republicans and Democrats and are currently not expected have any major issues getting confirmed in the Senate. Of the multiple people that Biden has so far nominated, Tanden is "most definitely, singularly" worst positioned in terms of having a shot at being confirmed, one adviser to multiple GOP members tells CNN.Tanden is an ally of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and previously served as a senior adviser for health reform at the US Department of Health and Human Services during the Obama administration, where she helped work on the Affordable Care Act. Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is president pro tempore and the most senior Republican in the chamber, told reporters on Monday that Tanden's nomination "might be controversial" among his colleagues. He said he didn't yet have a position on how he would vote on her nomination. Josh Holmes, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's former chief of staff and campaign manager, reacted to the news of Tanden being nominated and wrote on Twitter, "And there's the sacrifice to the confirmation gods...."Tanden also received criticism by some on the left, mostly from her usual online critics and rivals. But her nomination was mostly applauded by progressives, including some with whom she had clashed in the past, in large part because of concerns that Biden might tap someone else, like former Biden chief of staff Bruce Reed, with a more hawkish record on the deficit."Bruce Reed is ideologically committed to austerity. Neera Tanden is not," tweeted Social Security Works communications director Linda Benesch. "Keeping Reed out of OMB is a big win."Tanden, who would be the first woman of color and first South Asian American to become director of the OMB if confirmed, has also received praise from several Democratic senators. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday praised Tanden and criticized Republicans for what he described as "crocodile tears." Tanden "is so eminently qualified that some on the Republican side, grasping at straws, have taken issue with comments made on Twitter criticizing the policy positions of Republicans in Congress," Schumer said on the Senate floor. "Honestly, the hypocrisy is astounding. If Republicans are concerned about criticism on Twitter, their complaints are better directed at President Trump."Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown praised Tanden as "smart, experienced, and qualified for the position of OMB Director." Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren responded directly to Brown's tweet and said she agreed. New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said he has known Tanden for more than two decades and tweeted, "She's brilliant and laser-focused on making our country a fairer place for all. I'm excited to work with her as she does the vital work of rebuilding our government." (CNN) - Health officials projected the Covid-19 surge in the fall would be brutal. November alone proved those predictions true, with about a third of the nation's total cases reported in just 30 days.Hospitalizations more than doubled since the beginning of November, and the United States saw more Covid-19 deaths last month than the pandemic's combined death toll in Australia, Canada, China, Japan and Germany, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The grim numbers have unleashed devastation across the country: Trailers are turned into morgues and facilities are being converted to emergency hospitals to help respond to the surging number of patients. And across the United States, governors in at least half of all states announced statewide measures in hopes of slowing the spread of Covid-19. But the numbers will likely get much worse before a possible vaccine begins to offer some relief in the spring. Experts say the daily death toll will double in the coming days, while infections will likely see another surge in a few weeks, fueled by Thanksgiving travel and gatherings. Here's just how bad November was:51 deaths every hourMore than 36,900 Americans died of Covid-19 last month. In comparison, the flu killed about 22,000 Americans during the 2019-2020 season, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In November, the United States averaged about 1,231 Covid-19 deaths every day -- about 51 people every single hour. Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a professor of medicine at George Washington University, predicted last week that the US will likely begin to see close to 4,000 daily deaths in just a matter of days. 102% increase in hospitalizations Hospitalizations more than doubled last month, with a harrowing 102% increase since the first day of November, when there were 47,502 Covid-19 patients nationwide, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Hospitalizations have more than tripled since October 1, according to the project's data. For 17 days in a row during November, the country kept breaking hospitalization records. On Monday, after another series of record-breaking days, another new high: more than 96,000 patients nationwide. The surge in Covid-19 has crippled hospital systems across the country: beds are quickly filling up and health care workers are overworked, exhausted and traumatized by the monthslong crisis -- and many have fallen ill themselves from the virus. And rural hospitals -- often with a much more limited ICU capacity -- will likely have it much worse, experts have said. More cases than the first five months combined More than 4.4 million new infections were reported in November.That's nearly as many as the total number of cases reported in the United States during the first five months in the pandemic. It's also nearly as many people as the entire populations of Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Delaware -- combined. For 28 days in a row, the United States has continuously reported more than 100,000 new cases daily. During the summer surge, daily cases peaked at a little more than 77,100 on July 16. The sharp increases meant it only took several days each time for the nation to add another million to its case count. The United States hit 9 million Covid-19 cases on October 30. It took nine days to reach 10 million. It took another week to climb by another million. Six days later, 12 million infections. Six days after that, on November 27, the United States hit 13 million cases. The numbers are high -- but leading health experts have said they likely represent only a fraction of the true number of US infections, as many go undiagnosed or show no symptoms. CDC researchers said in November only about 1 in 8 -- or 13% -- of all Covid-19 infections in the US were recognized and reported through the end of September. That estimate means that as many as 53 million Americans could have been infected from February through September. Yet, there were only 7 million confirmed cases of symptomatic Covid-19 reported nationally during that time. 28% increase in child cases over 2 weeks  As of November 19, the latest data available, nearly 1.2 million children have tested positive for Covid-19 since the pandemic's start. And over just two weeks -- between November 5 to November 19 -- the number of child cases increased by 28%, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association. Children now represent nearly 12% of all Covid-19 cases in the country.Infections in children are climbing as local leaders again have been left to navigate whether students should transition to remote learning or stay in class. Leading health experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, have advocated for keeping schools open while closing bars and indoor-seated restaurants. Despite numbers, Sunday saw most travels since MarchDespite the awful numbers, some Americans haven't heeded the warnings. While officials across the country have highlighted the role of gatherings in the transmission of the virus, authorities continue to crack down on crowded events, including an illegal Manhattan bottle club with 400 people and a Chicago party with about 300 guests. And even though the CDC warned against travel for Thanksgiving, millions boarded planes ahead of the holiday. On Sunday, Transportation Security Administration officers screened more than 1.1 million people, according to a TSA spokeswoman. That's the highest number since mid-March. With Americans departing from all corners of the country and returning days later, Reiner warned this holiday had the potential to be the "mother of all superspreader events." That could likely translate in another surge stacked on top of the current one, and these numbers will only keep going up.Washington  (CNN) - CNN's Jake Tapper will interview President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on Thursday in their first joint interview since winning the election, the network announced Tuesday. Part of the interview will air on CNN's "The Lead" in the 4 p.m. ET hour and "The Situation Room" in the 5 and 6 p.m. ET hour on Thursday, and the full interview will air later the same day during an hour-long special at 9 p.m. ET. It will be simulcast on CNN International and in Spanish on CNN en Español. The interview will take place in Biden's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, at the same theater where the President-elect unveiled several top members of his administration. Since being projected the winners of November's election, Biden and Harris have moved quickly to build out a diverse administration that will help them tackle the nation's most pressing issues. This week, Biden unveiled top members of his economic team who, if confirmed by the Senate, will spearhead an effort to rebuild an economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, the President-elect introduced key members of his foreign policy and national security teams. Biden also recently announced an all-female White House senior communications team.During Biden's first 100 days in office after being sworn in on January 20, the President-elect and his team are expected to focus on passing a broad economic aid package and, where legislation is not necessary, put forth a series of executive actions aimed at advancing his priorities, CNN has reported. Republicans currently hold a majority in the Senate but control of the chamber will be determined by two runoff elections in Georgia in January. The scope of the stimulus legislation, the confirmation process of Biden's Cabinet nominees, and other legislative priorities will be affected by whether Republicans keep control of the Senate. Transition officials say containing the Covid-19 pandemic is at the top of the list of the President-elect's priorities. Biden's team will also be in charge of executing a mass vaccination campaign across the country when a coronavirus vaccine is approved. Launching an economic recovery and tackling racial inequality are also among his most urgent priorities, according to transition officials.  Washington  (CNN) - It's been months of haggling, backing away from negotiations, getting the gang back together and still a stimulus deal has proven elusive for Capitol Hill. The forces of partisanship aren't going to make that any easier now. Republicans are dug in and very much aware that Democrats would prefer a deal now in an effort to give President-elect Joe Biden a clean slate in January. The party to watch right now isn't Republicans, it's Democrats and just how much they are willing to give to ensure Biden can start his Presidency with some kind of economic recovery bill already in his rearview mirror.If something is going to happen, the time is now for those negotiations to ramp up. And there will be a bit of movement Tuesday.What is happening: One bipartisan effort ramps up Leadership aides are talking about what might be able to be attached to the omnibus spending bill that funds the government and faces a December 11 deadline for passage. A bipartisan group of members is ramping up their own calls to act. Tuesday, one of those groups, which has included Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney, Bill Cassidy and Susan Collins and Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin, Mark Warner, Jeanne Shaheen as well as independent Sen. Angus King, will have an announcement at 10 a.m. ET on a proposal they hope will kickstart those talks. The group met before Thanksgiving in person and kept up over Zoom during the Thanksgiving break. They met again on Monday night. Let's keep this development in context: There is no guarantee that even their agreement will move the needle or win over leadership. However, their efforts are some of the only signs of progress we are seeing on Capitol Hill right now so they can't be completely ignored.According to one aide familiar with the talks, members in the group have aimed to try to find the areas they could agree on: extending unemployment benefits, expanding school funding, providing money for more testing and vaccine distribution and re-upping another round of the Paycheck Protection Program. These are ideas that members have rallied around for month. This is just the first time senators are putting pen to paper. The group had also been looking at ways to agree on state and local funding and liability, but those are areas that have been tougher.What you still haven't seen: Ultimately, the House and Senate are all about leadership and those talks still are stalled. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy haven't been in a room hashing out the details for hours on end. In fact, the top negotiators here haven't met since the election to try and come together. That's not a great sign when you consider how leadership-driven the last stimulus bills have been.Why this week matters so muchThere are only two weeks left on the legislative calendar. That doesn't mean members couldn't stay longer on Capitol Hill and try to sort out an agreement before Christmas. But, the only hope for a stimulus deal right now is to attach it to the spending bill that has a deadline of December 11. Congress might be able to kick the can down the road for a few days, but at the end of the month, there is a massive cliff when the expiration of unemployment benefits, student loan payment deferrals and a federal eviction moratorium all run out.   Add to that the reality that this isn't a normal year. This is a year when a pandemic is threatening the very place where the deal has to get done. Dozens of members have gotten sick, and as cases spike around the country, members are even less inclined to stick around the Capitol. Sometimes, Congress likes to cancel a recess and look like they are trying just for the sake of optics. With a pandemic raging around them and in their very midst, no one has an appetite for that.What leadership is sayingLanguage surrounding these talks appears to be softening. Here's McConnell and Schumer on the floor on Monday saying a deal should get done before lawmakers depart for the holiday. Note the calls to come together.     • McConnell: "There is no reason -- none -- that we shouldn't deliver another major pandemic relief package."     • Schumer: "We need to come together. Both sides must give."Another important shift happening on the Hill right nowWhile progress among leaders remains elusive, Democratic senators are opening up to a smaller Covid-19 relief deal. How small is another question entirely, but multiple Democratic members CNN spoke to on Monday night said a deal is so crucial, they would be willing to find something between Republicans' $500 billion proposal and Pelosi's $2 trillion bill if it meant coming home with a deal.There are a lot of motivations for this. For one, members want to deliver Biden something before he takes office. The other factor? People are really hurting and folks are ready to try and come to the table."It's incredibly important we have an agreement," said Sen. Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat. "I don't want to negotiate publicly, but we gotta get something done.""I think the most important thing about any package is ... it's going to be very targeted to where you want the money to go," said Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana. "Now, it can't be so small ... where you're going to have people running around saying gee what's up with that, where it really doesn't get the job done."Pressed on if he could back something less than $2 trillion, New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez said, "It depends how it's divided up. It's possible."King also said "yes" when asked if he could support less than $2 trillion.You can also expect that House Democrats are going to ramp up pressure on Pelosi when House members return Wednesday. One freshman, Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, told CNN before Thanksgiving that his support for the speaker was going to be contingent on whether or not she could deliver a stimulus bill before the end of the year."I need to see a Covid relief bill passed before the end of the year," he said. "There is no higher priority."(CNN) - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is circulating a new relief plan as part of a last-ditch effort to pass a bill to prop up the struggling economy before year's end, moving to lock down Republican support even as a number of his own members and Democrats push for a different approach.For days, McConnell has been in private discussions with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, getting a clear sense of what President Donald Trump is willing to sign into law in his final days in office. As McConnell drafts a new bill based on those conversations, Democratic leaders are making their own counteroffer to jumpstart the talks while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke Tuesday to Mnuchin for the first time since late October.The flurry of activity was a sign of the growing pressure facing party leaders to respond to the deepening crisis with the economy still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, and as lawmakers race to finish their work for the year before a new Congress is sworn in next month. But there are still enormous divides between the two parties -- and internal party divisions -- meaning it's far from clear whether any proposal stands a chance of becoming law before Trump leaves office on January 20."I think the one thing we all agree on is we don't have time for messaging games, we don't have time for lengthy negotiations," McConnell told reporters on Tuesday. "The issue is: we want to get a result and I like to remind everybody that the way you get a result is you have to have a presidential signature."McConnell's move is an implicit rejection of a $908 billion bipartisan plan that a group of senators introduced Tuesday. Rather than embracing that bipartisan proposal, McConnell's outline resembles a $500 billion GOP proposal that Senate Democrats already blocked twice this year.GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who worked with her colleagues on the bipartisan plan, raised objections to his efforts on a private conference call on Tuesday, according to a source on the call. She later seemed cool to McConnell's push when asked by reporters in the Capitol."The advantage of our compromise bill is it has bipartisan, bicameral support," Collins said. "And we'll see what the leader introduces. But if it's identical to what he brought forth this summer, then it's going to be a partisan bill, and that's not going to become law. And I want a bill that's going to become law."But the bipartisan plan includes a price tag viewed as too high for many Republicans, plus it includes $160 billion to help state and local governments hurt by the pandemic -- an idea that has stiff GOP opposition."That's a big non-starter with a lot of our members," Senate Majority Whip John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Tuesday.According to a draft of the McConnell plan obtained by CNN, it includes roughly $332 billion in small business assistance programs, and would provide a new round of Paycheck Protection Program loans. It would provide loan forgiveness for the US Postal Service in the amount of $10 billion, a one-month extension of the pandemic emergency unemployment assistance program and an authorization for short-term aid to child care providers. The plan does not include any money for state and local governments, however, a key Democratic priority.McConnell indicated Tuesday that Republicans may try to combine the new stimulus proposal with legislation to keep the government funded and prevent a shutdown by the December 11 government funding deadline. But the Senate majority leader will need bipartisan support to accomplish that task.Stimulus talks have stopped and started repeatedly, but so far Republicans and Democrats have remained deadlocked, despite widespread agreement that more is needed amid fallout from the pandemic. Before the election, the White House proposed spending around $1.8 trillion, nearing Pelosi's demand of $2.2 trillion. But the White House's proposal fell flat with the California Democrat, who objected to many of the details, and Senate Republicans balked at a price tag that they said was far too high as many were unwilling to entertain a number more than $1 trillion. Talks between Pelosi and Mnuchin ultimately collapsed.There has been renewed pressure in recent days from rank-and-file members on their leadership to pass some form of stimulus as the country faces a cliff at the end of the year when multiple provisions will expire, leading to the bipartisan plan that rolled out Tuesday morning in the Senate that comes with a price tag of $908 billion. Privately, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer made their own counter-proposal to McConnell on Monday evening. Schumer refused to disclose the details of the plan.But he took a shot at McConnell for trying to advance a new GOP proposal without consulting Democrats."I just heard Leader McConnell say he's going to put another partisan proposal on the floor, he's going to talk to McCarthy and Trump and put something on the floor," Schumer said. "The obvious fact of the matter is, the biggest impediment to getting an agreement is the Republican leader refusing to negotiate in a bipartisan way."After her conversation with Mnuchin, Pelosi said in a statement that the Treasury secretary would review their proposal."Additional Covid relief is long overdue and must be passed in this lame-duck session," she said.(CNN) - Alexis Robinault, a 26-year-old Instagram influencer with over 30,000 followers, was found dead off a Houston interstate last week, police said. Robinault's body was found Saturday morning on a stretch of road in northwest Houston. The Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences identified her body, which had no visible injuries, Houston police said in a news release. Her autopsy is pending, so her cause of death is unknown, police said. The department's homicide division is investigating her case.  Robinault, who used the name "Alexis Sharkey" on Instagram, shared photos from her travels around Texas and beyond with her followers. Her mother, Stacey, told CNN affiliate KTRK she hadn't spoken to her daughter since Thanksgiving, days before her body was found. Robinault "traveled as much as she could" and dreamed of seeing the world, her mother said. Despite her modest online following, Robinault was never less than her truest self. "For her integrity, it was just so obvious that what she had out there was who she was and what she believed in," Stacey Robinault told KTRK.When reached for comment, the Houston Police Department directed CNN to its Twitter page, where police said they'll share updates on the case.

View more opinion articles on CNN.(CNN) - The fragile unity within the Democratic Party that helped propel a cohesive message in the fall that centered on making America empathetic again -- stopping the coronavirus, halting the pandemic-induced economic recession and confronting the nation's deep-seated racial divisions -- is once again in danger of unraveling. President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris garnered the most popular votes in American history, but their victory failed to produce the desired Congressional wave effect; the Democratic Party's hopes of a Senate majority now rest on the slender thread of two Georgia run-off elections. While centrist Democrats lost close-fought congressional elections, the hoped for embrace of progressive Democratic majorities in both houses failed to materialize. It's an old fight, but with new participants. Rising centrist Democratic legislators, most notably Pennsylvania congressman Conor Lamb, have had harsh words for the party's progressive leaders, led by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for advocating radical proposals that frightened moderate voters and cost the party the down-ballot votes that might have captured the senate and added seats in the house. From Lamb's perspective, Ocasio-Cortez and her allies relish in throwing out rhetorical Molotov cocktails from the security of safe districts, advocating policies that "aren't just unpopular, they're completely unrealistic, and they aren't going to happen." Ocasio-Cortez offered an alternative view for Democratic losses in Republican leaning districts. Rather than blame progressive support for Black Lives Matter and calls to "Defund the Police" for Democrats' losses, Ocasio-Cortez contended the party would be better off articulating a clear message about where they stand, who they are and where they see the country going. "We need to do a lot of anti-racist, deep canvassing in this country," explained Ocasio-Cortez. The longstanding civil war within the Democratic Party continues. Political and ideological battles over racial justice, the role of the federal government and the meaning of citizenship have been waged within the Democratic Party since the New Deal helped usher in an unwieldly coalition of liberals, Southern conservative segregationists (sometimes called Dixiecrats), moderates and progressives. Civil rights, Vietnam and economic decline helped to fracture this coalition after 1968, leading to political realignment that found white voters rushing to the Republican Party in droves.  This loop of history matters in particular because the Democratic Party's 2020 presidential victory should not be mistaken as a triumph over Trumpism, or over the darker structural, political and cultural forces that have led us to this moment of national crisis. Our contemporary national crisis is rooted in some of the same primeval forces that led to the national decline of the Democratic Party beginning in the late 1960s. Covid-19's disproportionate, and continuing, impact on BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) communities nationwide has amplified pre-existing historic inequities that have plagued American society for decades, in some instances, for centuries. A fissure with deep historical roots This political and ideological dissonance between Lamb and Ocasio-Cortez reflects a larger national debate over race, democracy and citizenship that has deep historical roots -- and cannot be papered over by the folksy appeal of Biden or Harris' barrier-breaking identity. And it's an urgent question, because whether or not the Democratic Party can bridge the yawning gulf between the world views, in policy and politics, of its centrist and progressive wings may very well decide the future of American democracy.  Part of this disagreement stems from the winner-take-all political climate fostered by gerrymandering Congressional districts and statehouses and other structural transformations that have disincentivized political compromise.   After former President Ronald Reagan successfully eroded New Deal social policy, former President Bill Clinton responded to the harsh political realities for Democrats engendered by the Reagan-Bush years through "triangulation," a term coined by Clinton political advisor Dick Morris, designed to court swing votes by abandoning progressives. Rather than challenging GOP political philosophy directly, this approach conceded the meat of political debates to Republicans by passing politically expedient, morally reprehensible crime and welfare legislation to solidify support with centrist voters.  What looked to some like bipartisanship was really a structurally rigged game from the start. Ralph Nader's surprisingly robust 2000 presidential campaign represented the pre-Bernie Sanders' Left's response to Clinton's centrism. National Democrats, including Biden (who later publicly regretted his role in fashioning the crime bill), joined in the politics of triangulation, casting aside policy choices that would have attacked the roots of urban poverty, violence and crime in favor of photo-op politics that invariably ended with increased investments in systems of punishment rather than people Former President Barack Obama tried to transcend these structural impediments. Obama's 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote speech called the nation back to the Founders' dreams of non-partisanship, memorably arguing "there's not a liberal America and a conservative America," but simply "the United States of America." But as his recent memoir illuminates, once he became president, Obama's hopes for bipartisan cooperation crashed on the shoals of GOP obstruction (fueled in part by Tea Party fervor) and Donald Trump's birtherism conspiracy, the last a racist fiction alleging the president was born in Kenya -- not Hawaii. The enduring irony here is that perhaps the most hopeful president in American history inadvertently helped to launch the most cynical.What happens now that Biden will be president Clinton's pragmatic centrism and Obama's attempted hopeful transformations -- two efforts to which Biden was vital -- both proved unable to halt structural inequities within America's democratic system that have accelerated at a breathtaking pace over the course of the Trump Presidency. Now that Biden will be President, the fissures in his Party threaten to keep Trumpism alive. The strength of the Democratic Party's progressive wing lies in confronting this reality with bold policy ambitions -- from Medicare for All, the Green New Deal and yes, investing more resources into eradicating poverty, violence, and inequality than are directed toward police and punishment. These are goals that prioritize real people over property, support voting rights as sacrosanct and reimagine the rights of citizenship to include access to quality and debt free education, healthcare, food, and protection from structural and physical violence.  The allure of the centrist Democrats can be found in their belief that politics is based on the art of the possible. From this perspective the most enduring change is incremental, built brick by brick and based in a kind of bipartisanship that prioritizes the fears, anxieties, and wants of predominantly White moderates.  Lamb, who rightfully points out that his majority-White district's constituents and their hopes and dreams stand in stark contrast to Ocasio-Cortez's racially diverse district's, appears to long for the return to the kind of bipartisan centrism that, although temperamentally more civil that our current era, has contributed mercilessly to the disenfranchisement of Black Americans. One sees the troubling effects of this toxic 1990s neo-liberalism in mass incarceration, the exploitation of immigrants, intolerance toward LGBTQ communities, and the devaluing of women, especially Black women, in policy and politics. The Democratic Party's best chance to help shape the future The historic and ongoing protests against racial justice in 2020 show us that there is no normal to return to. The nation's political center of gravity has forever shifted and our institutions and political parties have yet to catch up. Americans have a generational opportunity to confront issues for which broad social (if not political) support has long existed -- issues of housing affordability, income and wealth inequality, criminal justice reform, unemployment and environmental injustice rooted in racist policies that can no longer be ignored, massaged or ameliorated.  The Democratic Party's best chance to help shape the future is not by negotiating some kind of backroom compromise between the Green New Deal and more incremental measures that attempt to nibble around the edges of systemic racism, entrenched poverty, economic inequality, racial segregation and violence against women, immigrants, the incarcerated, and LGBTQ communities. President-elect Biden must use the most important bully-pulpit in the world to advance a racially inclusive and economically expansive vision of American democracy, one rooted not just in the pragmatic limits of his ability to pass consequential legislation.  The Democratic Party is more important now more than ever precisely because our two-party system is broken. We have one major party that has advocated voter suppression, whose leaders have largely refused to acknowledge Biden's election and allowed themselves to be bullied, badgered and broken by President Trump. Republicans won the presidency in 2016, made gains in the House of Representatives and appear likely to hold onto the Senate at the cost of the party's soul and the integrity of many of its national leaders. This sorry state of affairs means that unless and until the GOP recovers the conservative principles that allowed political centrists such as former President Dwight Eisenhower and social liberals like New York City Mayor John Lindsay to find room in the party, the future of national progress lies in the hands of Democrats.   Both sides within the Democratic Party must recognize the depth and breadth of the problems facing the nation and our planet. Forging a consensus around anti-racism, climate change, and ending poverty requires facing unpleasant political realities. These include recognizing the central place that the struggles for dignity and citizenship being waged by BIPOC around the nation to fight the ravages of the pandemic and in support of Black lives is pivotal to the Democratic Party's future. Debates within the party should be less about the practicality of birthing new freedoms than our shared responsibility -- whether Democratic centrists, moderates, liberals or progressives -- of forging a broad-based national consensus, outlining bold steps toward achieving policy and political solutions that these watershed historical times demand. This requires the kind of political vision that Democrats such as FDR and LBJ articulated in a manner that, for a time at least, galvanized the nation beyond partisanship. The New Deal and Great Society, for all of their shortcomings and disappointments, called on Americans to embrace big ideas that could only be accomplished through a collective national will. Forged through depression and war, postwar America led the world, at its best, by setting a powerful example of the great things that could be accomplished by a good people. American identity in the 21st century has been reshaped by the structural violence of economic dispossession, mass incarceration, systemic racism and a plague that continues unabated. Now is the time for the Democratic Party to go big or go home by embracing audacious freedom dreams that call us toward the kind of aspirational citizenship that, from JFK to Obama, allowed us to believe that America was a place where all things are possible. (CNN) - Patricia and Leslie McWaters spent 47 years together, raising their children, then grandchildren and then great-grandchildren. And last week, they died together of Covid-19, within the same minute."They literally did everything together and although we're shocked about it, when we look at it, we also think it's not so surprising, because they were together all the time and they had so much fun together in life," said one of their two daughters, Joana Sisk.The McWaters are among the 268,087 people to have died from the coronavirus in the US, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. And as the number of hospitalizations consistently reaches new highs, experts worry higher numbers of deaths will follow.At first glance, the two were quite different: she was a no-nonsense retired nurse, and he was a fun-loving veteran and retired truck driver. She was the boss, and he was the king of one-liners. But the common denominator everyone saw between Patricia and Leslie "LD" McWaters, Sisk said, was their genuine kindness and care for other people.They enjoyed being together hosting pool parties, attending family sporting events and going dancing at the bar where they met. "Pat was the most beautiful woman ever and boy did she look good in hot pants and go-go boots!" Sisk remembers her father saying. But then Pat went to the hospital to get treatment for a coronavirus infection, Sisk said. She was told to go home and isolate, which she did. After 35 years in the medical field, she didn't question the doctors, though she felt poorly, Sisk said.The following week, the couple went to the hospital again, this time in an ambulance. They were there for a week. When they died of the virus, the hospital staff tending to them said their times were too close to call, and recorded the exact same time: Tuesday, November 24, 2020 at 4:23 p.m."Those of us that know them, know that mom went first and said, "LD, it's time to go!" Sisk said.Sisk said she wishes her parents had a different outcome in their illness, and, though her family hadn't always taken it as seriously as they do now, stressed the importance of wearing a mask to not spread the virus to others. She specifically put their cause of death in their obituary to spread awareness in hopes of saving someone else, she said. "I'm so thrilled that my mom, being the nurse that she was ... that even in heaven she's going to keep saving lives and it means so much," Sisk said.Washington  (CNN) - Dr. Scott Atlas, a highly controversial member of the White House's coronavirus task force, has resigned from his post in the Trump administration, according to a person who works with the task force. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  This story is breaking and will be updated. (CNN) - The Justice Department is investigating a potential crime related to funneling money to the White House or related political committee in exchange for a presidential pardon, according to court records unsealed Tuesday in federal court. The case is the latest legal twist in the waning days of President Donald Trump's administration after several of his top advisers have been convicted of federal criminal charges and as the possibility rises of Trump giving pardons to those who've been loyal to him.The disclosure is in 20 pages of partially redacted documents made public by the DC District Court on Tuesday afternoon. The records show Chief Judge Beryl Howell's review in August of a request from prosecutors to access documents obtained in a search as part of a bribery-for-pardon investigation.The filings don't reveal a timeline of the alleged scheme, or any names of people potentially involved, except that communications between people including at least one lawyer were seized from an office that was raided sometime before the end of this summer. No one appears to have been publicly charged with a related crime to date.At the end of this summer, a filter team, used to make sure prosecutors don't receive tainted evidence that should have been kept from them because it was privileged, had more than 50 digital devices including iPhones, iPads, laptops, thumb drives and computer drives after investigators raided the unidentified offices.Prosecutors told the court they wanted permission to the filter team's holdings. The prosecutors believed the devices revealed emails that showed allegedly criminal activity, including a "secret lobbying scheme" and a bribery conspiracy that offered "a substantial political contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon or reprieve of sentence" for a convicted defendant whose name is redacted, according to the redacted documents. Communications between attorneys and clients are typically privileged and kept from prosecutors as they build their cases, but in this situation, Howell allowed the prosecutors access. Attorney-client communications are not protected as privileged under the law when there is discussion of a crime, among other exceptions."The political strategy to obtain a presidential pardon was 'parallel' to and distinct from [redacted]'s role as an attorney-advocate for [redacted name]," Howell wrote in her court order.The grand jury investigation also appears to relate to unnamed people acting as unregistered "lobbyists to senior White House officials" as they sought to secure a pardon and use an intermediary to send a bribe, the unsealed court records say. Prosecutors hadn't provided evidence to the judge, however, of any direct payment, and instead showed evidence that a person was seeking clemency because of past and future political contributions.The investigators indicated in court that they intended to "confront" three people with the communications and complete their investigation. Over the last week, the Justice Department told Howell it wanted to keep filings related to the matter confidential in court, because "individuals and conduct" hadn't yet been charged.This story is breaking and will be updated.(CNN) - Paul Walker died in a car crash on November 30, 2013, and some people who loved him marked the day. On Monday the "Fast and Furious" star's 22-year-old daughter, Meadow, posted an old photo of her and her father on her verified Instagram account."A silly day to remember in sadness. today's a celebration of the love and happiness you brought to the world," the caption read. "Here's a photo of my best bud & I napping." The actor was a passenger in a 2005 Porsche Carrera GT that slammed into a light pole and burst into flames in the community of Valencia in Santa Clarita, about 30 miles north of Hollywood.The car was driven by his racing team partner Roger Rodas, who also died in the crash. Walker's "Fast and Furious" co-star and close friend Vin Diesel also posted a photo of him and the late star on his verified Instagram account."Seven years...Not a day passes...All love, Always," DIesel's caption read.Their fellow co-star Jordana Brewster posted a photo of Walker writing simply, "7 years." Meadow Walker also honored her dad in September on what would have been his 47th birthday. (CNN) - The Texas doctor captured on film cradling a distraught Covid-19 patient on Thanksgiving has spoken of the sad isolation of his elderly patients and pleaded with people to "do the basic things" to avoid infection and stay out of hospital.Hospitalizations from Covid-19 reached another record high across the US Monday, with officials across several states expressing concern that health care facilities would be overwhelmed.Dr. Joseph Varon, chief of staff at United Memorial Medical Center in Houston, told CNN's New Day on Monday that he had worked for 256 days nonstop in the pandemic so far and was frustrated by the increasing numbers of people being hospitalized.Varon described the desperation of Covid-19 patients on his wards, who he said were battling isolation as well as the virus. The man he had been consoling in the photo just wanted his family, the doctor said."As I'm going inside my Covid unit I see that this elderly patient is out of his bed and trying to get out of the room and he's crying. So, I get close to him and I tell him 'why are you crying' and the man says, 'I want to be with my wife'," Varon said. "So, I just grab him, I hold him, I did not know that I was being photographed at that time."Varon said eventually the man felt better and stopped crying. But he said the patient would not be able to see his wife until he tested negative on his swabs and could be discharged. 'You feel isolated'"It's very difficult. You can imagine. You are inside a room where people come in in 'spacesuits' and you have no communication with anybody else, only by phone if you're lucky. I mean it's very difficult and when you are an elderly individual it's even more difficult because you feel that you are alone. You feel isolated."Varon said as he held the man, he recollected all the other patients that he'd had to similarly console."I will go into their rooms; I will sit on their bed and chat with them because they truly need somebody to give them a hand. And my staff is very good at doing this, but we have so many patients that sometimes we cannot hold every patient or grab the hand of a patient or at least try to be a little more human," the doctor said. "Some of them cry, some of them try to escape -- we actually had somebody that tried to escape through a window the other day."The man in the photo may be able to see his wife soon, Varon said. His condition had improved, and staff hoped that he might be discharged by the end of the week.The doctor's battle, however, continues."I don't know what keeps me going, I don't know how I haven't broken down," he said. "My nurses have broken down. My nurses cry in the middle of the day because they get so sad, sometimes for situations like this. Just seeing a patient that's crying because he wants to see his family."'Keep your social distance; wear your mask; wash your hands' Varon said he was frustrated by people not doing the right thing as coronavirus patients continue to fill his hospital beds."I do this day in and day out and people are out there doing the wrong thing. People are out there in bars, restaurants, malls -- it is crazy -- it's like we work, work, work, work, work and people don't listen and then they end up in my ICU," he said."What people need to know is that -- I don't want to have to be hugging them. They need to do the basic things: keep your social distance; wear your mask; wash your hands and avoid going to places where there are a lot of people. Very simple. If people can do that health care workers like me will be able to -- hopefully rest."Varon said he was trying to be transparent to the media so that the public could see the reality of the situation in his hospital and had given Getty photographer Go Nakamura access to his Covid-19 ward, which is how the image of him had been captured.READ: This doctor just endured the deadliest week of his careerWorsening crisisNakamura posted the photo on his Facebook account with the caption: "Nov. 26. Dr. Joseph Varon comforts a patient with coronavirus disease. I am grateful to witness a wonderful moment and I thank all the medical staffs for their hard work even during the holiday season. Photographed for @gettyimages #covidera #photojournalism"Other photos from the hospital posted on Nakamura's feed show masked medical workers treating patients or resting, seemingly exhausted.Varon also spoke to CNN's New Day on November 25, warning that the crisis was worsening."For the last few days, we've had a steady increase in the number of cases. There's no question that patients are coming into the hospital -- they are coming in sicker. And they are coming in sicker because they are waiting longer to come to the hospital. They are tired of corona; they have what I call the 'Corona Fatigue Syndrome.' Everybody's tired of Corona, so they wait, they wait longer," he said then."Unfortunately, my concerns for the next six to 12 weeks is that if we don't do things right, America is going to see the darkest day in modern American medical history."Varon said his hospital had opened two new wings to prepare for an expected influx of patients after Thanksgiving as the pandemic's relentless cycle continued."This is taking a huge toll. Not only on me but on my health care people that work with me. My nurses, in the middle of the day they will start crying because you know they are getting so many patients and it's a never-ending story. When they finish finally getting a patient in, they get a phone call from the ER that there is another patient that is being admitted," he said.Some 96,039 Covid-19 patients were hospitalized across the US as of Monday evening, according to the Covid Tracking Project and the virus's toll continues to climb. Johns Hopkins University reported 157,901 new cases and 1,172 deaths Monday, taking the US totals to more than 13,500,000 cases and at least 268,045 lives lost from Covid-19.Editor's Note: Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio's daily program "The Dean Obeidallah Show" and a columnist for The Daily Beast.

View more opinion articles on CNN.(CNN) - Donald Trump desperately wants you to believe the only reason Joe Biden won the 2020 election by so many votes was because it was the "most fraudulent election in history." Trump served up his latest variation of this fallacy on Fox Business on Sunday morning, saying "we have so much evidence" to support his claims but the judges "won't allow us" to submit it.That's a lie. The truth is Trump's lawyers have had numerous opportunities to present the so-called evidence of voter fraud, but haven't. Why? Simple. There is no such evidence. Trump's own lawyers -- including Rudy Giuliani -- have repeatedly admitted in court cases from Arizona to Pennsylvania that they are not even alleging voter fraud in those lawsuits. The obvious reason being they can't prove the claims. There's a difference between what a client can scream in public and what a lawyer can say to a judge. As a lawyer myself, I know how it's drilled into our heads from law school that you could be disbarred if you intentionally lie to a judge. We have a "special duty as officers of the court" to be truthful to the court. Hence, Trump says one thing to the media and his lawyers tell a vastly different story to the courts. As a nation, we should actually be grateful Trump's campaign filed lawsuits in countless states. If Trump hadn't, the fact-checking would have been done primarily by the very journalists Trump has slammed for years as "enemies of the people." But by filing these legal actions, the people who have ruled that Trump's claims are baseless are judges across the political spectrum -- including one Trump nominated to the federal bench in 2017, Judge Stephanos Bibas.  In fact, Bibas, joined by Judges David Brooks Smith and Michael Chagares, both GOP-appointed judges to the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, wrote the unanimous decision released Friday that was a master class in decimating Trump's claims of voter fraud. The court first slammed Trump's efforts to overturn the election results in Pennsylvania, a state Biden won by more than 80,000 votes, writing, "Voters, not lawyers, choose the President. Ballots, not briefs, decide elections." The judges then reached the crux of Trump's claims of voter fraud, declaring that: "Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here." In fact, as the opinion stated, "The Campaign never alleges that any ballot was fraudulent or cast by an illegal voter," reiterating later that the Trump campaign "conceded that it is not alleging election fraud." So despite Trump's non-stop cries of voter fraud, when it came to the lawsuit, there was not even a claim of such wrongdoing. In fact, Giuliani admitted that in open court last week while appearing before federal Judge Matthew Brann in Pennsylvania.  "This is not a fraud case," Giuliani said in response to Brann's questioning.  This helps explain why, for example, while Trump repeatedly claims publicly that "dead people" voted in Pennsylvania -- even repeating that falsehood last Wednesday when he called into a news conference held in Gettysburg by a handful of Pennsylvania GOP state legislators -- Trump's lawyers conceded in another lawsuit in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that there was "no evidence" a ballot was cast by "a deceased person." Lawyers in general won't risk being disbarred to help a client by lying to the court.We've seen similar outcomes in connection with campaign lawsuits filed in other battleground states that Trump lost. In Arizona, Trump's lawyer Kory Langhofer filed a lawsuit to contest the results that Biden had won the state. But Langhofer didn't parrot Trump's claims of voter fraud. Rather, he argued that a "limited number" of ballots should be reviewed because it appeared there were "good faith errors" in operating machines. "This is not a fraud case," said Langhofer. "We're not alleging anyone's stealing the election." That lawsuit was ultimately dropped by the Trump campaign since they admitted the claims wouldn't change the fact Biden won. In Michigan, the Trump campaign voluntarily dropped its lawsuit alleging voter fraud -- falsely claiming it dropped the lawsuit because it had succeeded at stopping the certification of the election results in Michigan's Wayne County. It hadn't; the results were certified in accordance with Michigan law. Trump can keep repeating his claims the election was "rigged," "fake," a "hoax" ... yadda, yadda, yadda. After four-plus years of Trump, we all know his go-to buzzwords. The truth is that Trump has been given his day in court to prove his case and he has failed -- over and over. Thanks to these lawsuits, it's clear that at this point the only fraud in the 2020 election is Donald Trump.(CNN) - Just like everything else, the holiday office party is going to look a lot different this year.Despite the drudgery that was 2020, employers still want to show their appreciation to their workers. But let's be honest: Scheduling a video meeting and calling it a "Holiday Party" isn't going to cut it, so some companies are getting creative. An all-day celebration Why limit an office party to just a few hours? Paypal is hosting a global 29-hour virtual party where employees can drop in whenever they want. The schedule is broken into eight different "destinations" during which site leaders from different offices across the globe are responsible for arranging virtual entertainment during their designated time. The online party will get started with circus performers, cultural art and performance workshops and a surprise headliner.Other events throughout the day include: a magic show, a singing competition, cooking classes, illusionist performances and a dance off. Planning for the event, called "All Together Gathering: A PayPal December to Remember" started back in April. "Virtual on camera and audio is our lives right now, we wanted to make sure [the party] is not just that. We want more connection, and an in-depth and more immersive environment," said Genessa Nannini, PayPal's director of people engagement. Group activity Last year, accounts payable software provider Tipalti threw a holiday party complete with a buffet dinner for employees and their spouses, followed by bowling."Everyone was celebratory," recalled Todd McGuire, the company's chief of staff. That's not going to work this year, but the company still wants to show its appreciation. "In a mess of a year, they have executed extraordinarily well," said McGuire. Company leaders considered paying for everyone to order dinner and eat together virtually, but decided it wouldn't offer enough interaction between teams. Instead, they are doing a virtual mixology event for employees. "Making it active makes it feel more festive, but it has specific break points -- you can push people into Zoom rooms where they can chat in a cross-functional way," said McGuire. Secret Santa and trivia The marketing team at digital media and promotions company Quotient is trying to add a more personal touch to its holiday celebrations. Members of the 37-person team can choose to participate in a Secret Santa gift exchange that has a $25 limit and gifts are sent directly to co-workers' homes. To avoid generic candles and bath soaps and inspire more original gift ideas, teammates can list their hobbies and interests on a shared spreadsheet. The department will also send a customized DIY cocktail kit to prepare drinks during their virtual party on Kumospace, an online platform that allows for multiple conversations in the same place at the same time.The virtual party will include a trivia contest that includes team members' personal stories, like any hidden talents, quirky stories or fun facts they want to share. "The goal of that is to have fun, and also to bring in the personal side between teammates who don't know that side of their team members," said Pola Zen, senior director of corporate marketing.Spreading out the joy The daily meetings at Natalist are about to become much more festive. The fertility and pregnancy products startup will do "12 days of Chrismahanukwanzakah" during their daily virtual meeting that will involve a brief game -- like a puzzle or riddle -- and the winner gets a small gadget.On the last day, employees will be able to expense their lunches to eat together virtually while playing games and doing a "mocktail" show-and-tell that involves colleagues making their favorite holiday beverage and sharing the recipe."We prioritize these moments of celebration. Those moments create a sense of belonging, and when employees feel they really belong somewhere, they are a lot more likely to make significant contributions, enjoy their work and are more likely to engage in a high accountability culture," said Chief Operating Officer Vernita Brown.

View more opinion at CNN.(CNN) - Last week, President Donald Trump announced three major pardons -- two traditional pardons for two turkeys named Corn and Cob on Tuesday and a controversial pardon of his former national security adviser Michael Flynn on Wednesday. For a President still hotly railing against the results of the presidential election, the Thanksgiving turkey pardons struck a strangely conventional note. By contrast, the executive clemency bestowed upon Flynn, who, after all, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, may bode a potentially erratic course ahead for this lame-duck administration.To date, Trump has issued just 29 total pardons, fewer than any other presidential term in modern history. George H.W. Bush, the previous one-term record holder for fewest pardons, granted 74.That pattern may change soon. As the end of his presidency approaches, pardon season is officially upon us. Perhaps most worrisome, speculation has run rampant that Trump may even try to pardon himself (something he likely can't do.)Since the turn of the 20th century, presidents have granted more than 21,000 pardons and commutations of sentences. More good than bad, presidential pardons have the power to undo past injustice and clear the name of those who were unfairly prosecuted for federal crimes (state-level offenses are tried separately). Overall, good pardons quell rough political waters and correct previous wrongdoings, while bad pardons diminish the prestige of the presidency and undermine the strength of American democracy.As Trump prepares to leave office, his pardon power may well be a defining part of his legacy. Rather than merely serving partisan ends, he can and should use the pardon power for good. By doing so, he can help to unify the country after this year's contentious presidential election.Let's start with the positive examples of pardons and commutations.President Warren HardingIn 1921, President Warren Harding commuted the prison sentence of Eugene V. Debs, a perennial presidential candidate for the Socialist Party. He had been arrested in 1918 after delivering a speech in Canton, Ohio, that encouraged resistance to American involvement in World War I. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison for violating the Espionage and Sedition Acts of 1917 and deprived of his citizenship rights, including the ability to vote. Incredibly, Debs received nearly 1 million votes for president in 1920, even though he was still imprisoned. Although Harding did not give a full pardon to Debs, the decision to commute the sentence helped the country to move beyond politically divisive rhetoric. Harding ably justified his decision in a letter to his close friend Malcolm Jennings: "I thought the spirit of clemency was quite in harmony with the things we were trying to do in Washington; that Debs had never been guilty of any overt act; that he never countenanced destruction of government by force, and probably I could persuade him to become a factor in contributing to tranquility throughout the land."Even as criticism surfaced from both the right and the left, the move safeguarded freedom of speech across the political spectrum. "We cannot punish men in America for the exercise of their freedom in political and religious belief," Harding said.Debs' legacy lived on. In July 1976, Congress voted to restore posthumously his rights of citizenship. Debs remains a hero to many on the left, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who made a documentary about him in 1979. President Jimmy CarterIn 1977, President Jimmy Carter offered pardons to the tens of thousands of young men who had resisted the draft. Set against the aftermath of the Vietnam War, Carter ordered Proclamation 4483 for those men who had resisted the Military Selective Service Act between 1964 and 1973. The proclamation encouraged as many as 100,000 Americans who had fled the country, primarily to Canada, to return home. By affording widespread amnesty, Carter hoped to provide much needed reconciliation for a divided country. Widespread anti-war protests had rocked the nation, including the killing of four university students at Kent State in 1970. And while President Gerald Ford had begun the process of reconciliation in 1974 by offering partial amnesty to draft resisters who performed public service, two years later, the question of full amnesty hinged on the outcome of the presidential election.While Carter had made widespread amnesty a campaign promise, the backlash against the order was swift. Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater called it the "most disgraceful thing that a president has ever done." Similarly, veterans' organizations opposed the move.In the end, many American ex-pats chose to stay in Canada. Nevertheless, Carter's sweeping offer of pardons represented the essential humanity of a President who wanted to heal the country after a long and grueling war. Historians now look back on the decision as a defining moment of Carter's presidency.By contrast, these presidential pardons stirred further division and hurt the country in the long run.President Gerald FordOn September 8, 1974, President Gerald Ford pardoned former President Richard Nixon for any crimes that he may have committed as part of the Watergate scandal. The announcement came on the heels of Ford's inaugural remarks of in August 1974, in which he declared the country's "long national nightmare" to be over.The Nixon pardon shocked the nation, and the public outcry was palpable. Most Americans polled on the subject wanted Nixon to be punished. At the very least, they wanted the judicial process to run its course. Some in Congress also decried that a deal had been cut between Nixon and Ford, though historians generally doubt this view.While it tore apart his administration, Ford maintained that pardoning Nixon was the right thing to do for the nation. In time, the view became more widely accepted, with even Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts expressing his support of the decision. But Ford also set a very troubling precedent. By not prosecuting the crimes of a public leader, a certain degree of accountability was lost and democracy itself weakened. Ford's pardon of Nixon remains the only such exoneration of a former President of the United States. President Bill Clinton On January 20, 2001, President Bill Clinton pardoned Marc Rich, a political supporter and financial backer. Rich, who had been indicted for tax evasion and wire fraud, among other charges, had been a target of federal investigation since the early 1980s. At one point, he stood at No. 6 on the most wanted list of fugitives. By issuing the pardon, Rich, who lived in exile in Switzerland, was cleared to return to the United States.The pardon proved so controversial -- the New York Times editorial board declared it "indefensible" -- that Clinton penned an op-ed defending his actions. For their part, Republicans initiated a congressional investigation, with Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania even moving to enact a constitutional amendment to allow Congress to overturn presidential pardons. Congressional efforts went nowhere, however.The Rich pardon remains a hot-button topic, as evidenced by new information surfacing during the 2016 presidential campaign. Though containing heavily redacted information, the FBI report released that year reminded voters of the shameful episode from Clinton's time in office. Clinton's defense notwithstanding, it well may be the worst pardon given by a president in the 21st century and has forever stained his legacy.The history of pardons and commutations reveals the broad powers granted to the president under Article II of the Constitution. The power to transform a person's life should be a cherished part of American democracy. However, presidential pardons do not always serve the best interests of the people, even when presidents intend to do so. Whether Trump will act for the good of the American people -- and not just in self-interest -- will be a closely watched aspect of his lame-duck presidency.(CNN) - President-elect Joe Biden's hopes of reviving the Iran nuclear deal may already be coming undone.The assassination last week of nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, apparently in a covert operation featuring a remote-controlled machine gun --was a new blow to Iranian pride following the US killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a January airstrike. Both incidents could wreck prospects for diplomacy.Tehran's clerical leaders now have a conundrum. Do they respond aggressively -- against the country accused of perpetrating the attack, Israel -- and risk a damaging escalation with the United States? Or do they absorb the politically embarrassing blow and hope dialogue with Biden could ease Trump administration sanctions that have strangled their economy?President Donald Trump would likely respond to Iranian military action. And a conflict would not just hand Biden an immediate crisis, it also would probably kill off any talks between Washington and Tehran. That is one reason why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has always opposed the nuclear deal, might have ordered the Fakhrizadeh attack.US hawks claim Trump's "maximum pressure policy" has handed Biden new leverage in negotiating with Iran after Trump pulled out of an Obama-era nuclear deal in 2018 that even US intelligence said Iran was respecting. But since then, Tehran has accumulated 12 times the amount of low enriched uranium permitted under the 2015 deal, according to a UN report in November, and is closer to the point at which it could break out toward a nuclear bomb. US sanctions, while inflicting terrible economic pain, show no sign of catalyzing the regime change hoped for by Trump's hardliners. Even if Biden is willing to return to the terms of the Iran nuclear deal, the case for diplomacy has been weakened by the Trump-ordered US strike that killed Soleimani. And how could pragmatists sell a new deal with the US that a future Republican President would likely ditch? An Iranian election next year, meanwhile, could deliver a new hardline president who opposes dialogue with the US.So critics of the deal in the US and Israel may well make it impossible for Biden to work with Iran. That will leave future US presidents with an awful choice — between living with the possibility of an Iranian bomb or ordering military action that could start a disastrous new war in the Middle East.The Covid bowlPlaying American football without a quarterback is almost as pointless as playing without a pigskin. But the Denver Broncos played with one hand behind their backs Sunday when their quarterbacks were ruled out of their game against the New Orleans Saints after being flagged as high-risk Covid-19 contacts and forced into quarantine. Not surprisingly, saddled with a rookie wide receiver in the crucial role that carries out complicated pre-drawn plays and sometimes changes tactics on the fly -- the Broncos lost 31-3. Their plight is the most extreme manifestation of the worsening pandemic's impact on the league, but there are so many incidents that doubts are growing that the NFL will make it to the Super Bowl early next year.The Baltimore Ravens thrice had a Thanksgiving game against the Pittsburgh Steelers called off. They are due to play Wednesday but could be without more than 20 players ruled out by positive Covid tests. The San Francisco 49s must now play in Arizona after officials in their home Santa Clara County banned contact sports amid a Covid spike. The Saints have been stripped of a draft pick and fined $500,000 for not wearing masks in the locker room.The NFL, which is a massive, television-driven business as well as America's favorite sport, has not opted to play its games in the kind of bio-secure bubble that helped NBA basketball and NHL hockey finish their delayed seasons. The NBA will face similar challenges in a nation wracked by out-of-control Covid cases when it comes back at Christmas playing in teams' home cities. The NHL, targeting an early 2021 puck drop, is mulling a unique Canadian division since the closed border with the US will make international travel impossible.Hopefully, by the time the NFL returns next September for its 2021 season, the promise of Covid-19 vaccines will have been fulfilled and will mean that playing and going to games will again be a ritual that everyone will take for granted.'The virus is not red or blue'The Rev. Raphael Warnock -- a Democratic candidate in one of two US Senate runoff elections in Georgia in January, which will decide which party controls the Senate -- on Monday bemoaned how even the coronavirus pandemic is viewed through a partisan lens."It's unfortunate that this virus has become a political issue. The virus is not red or blue. And the things that we need to do should be based on science and not on politics. ... For me it's as basic as love your neighbor. Love your neighbor, love your country, love yourself. Socially distance, wear a mask, wash your hands," Warnock said.Trumps' last Christmas at the White HouseDespite her scathing assessment in recently released audiotapes of hosting the festive season at the White House (in which she commented, "who gives a f*** about the Christmas stuff"), first lady Melania Trump wants it to be known she was the driving force behind decking the halls of the presidential mansion with boughs of holly this year.The theme for what, to quote George Michael, is the Trumps' "Last Christmas" at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. is "America the Beautiful."CNN's Betsy Klein reports that highlights this year include a tribute to essential workers in the Red Room, including a light-up ceramic post office, and a tree with ornaments celebrating front-line workers, including a trash truck, scientist, caregiver, lab coat and nurse hat.(CNN) - Comedy, oddity and tragedy.Those three words not only describe much of 2020, but they also describe much of 2020's top trending YouTube videos, made public by the platform on Tuesday.

Whether you struggle with video conference technology or got really into a new hobby this year, you, or at least someone you know, are comically represented and, kindly, poked fun at. Some Good News with John Krasinski Ep. 1, by SomeGoodNewsWith hundreds of thousands of deaths from the coronavirus pandemic and heightened tensions over racist violence, this year has been filled with bad news.So John Krasinski, the actor lovingly known for his role as Jim on "The Office," came through for us in quarantine with his YouTube show highlighting positive stories. It did everything: a tribute to frontline health care workers, a virtual prom and even a virtual wedding.Krasinski hosted eight episodes of the series before selling it to ViacomCBS. Episode 1 was the biggest hit, with 18.3 million views.(CNN) - Ryan Reynolds does not want the citizens of Vancouver to be cruising down a street named for him.The "Deadpool" actor responded to a petition calling for just that in his Canadian hometown."Very kind but hard pass," Reynolds tweeted. "If traffic sucks everyone will say, "Ryan Reynolds is a mess" or "Ryan Reynolds is really backed up." My brothers would enjoy this too much."The Change.org petition was started by "The Kevin and Sonia Show with Tara Jean" on Vancouver's 104.9 KiSS RADiO and states that the city's "favourite son, Ryan Reynolds, deserves to have a street named after him (or at least a lane). It's time.""Not only has he captured our hearts on the big screen, his humanitarian efforts have made him a beloved local treasure who encapsulates the best of Vancouverites, and fully deserving of this recognition in his hometown," the petition reads.It goes on to list several things Reynolds has done this year alone, including helping a woman find a treasured teddy bear and, along with his wife actress Blake Lively, donating $500,000 to help homeless and at-risk youth. The petition also notes that the request is a rare one."PS: We recognize the City of Vancouver *generally* only names streets after people who have passed, but there have been exceptions PLUS technically Ryan Reynolds is Dead(pool)," it reads. "We think we have a solid case here." (CNN) - A wide range of Republican senators are shrugging off President Donald Trump's evidence-free claims that mass voter fraud cost him the election, ignoring their party leader's relentless attacks against a foundation of American democracy amid their growing expectation that the matter will be resolved within two weeks -- without their involvement. As they watch Trump torch local Republicans and governors who refuse to try to overturn the election results, many have remained silent as more states certify Joe Biden's victory and more of the President's legal challenges collapse. A central factor around the GOP's decision to stay quiet: The two critical Georgia Senate runoffs where Trump can play a key role in turning out their base to help keep the chamber in Republican hands next Congress. Infuriating Trump now will only undercut their efforts to lean on a President who holds enormous sway with their core voters, Republican sources said Monday. In the meantime, some prominent senators on Monday dismissed the idea that they have much of a role to play in pushing back on Trump's unfounded claims as the legal and state certification process plays out -- as powerful Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell remained silent after saying little about the President's weeks-long campaign to undermine faith in the elections. McConnell walked by reporters in the Senate hallways Monday without responding to a question about Trump's actions or if he considers Biden to be the President-elect.Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of McConnell's leadership team, said Monday that the "verdict was rendered, and I think that's becoming clearer by the minute" and that he's "already moving on" to prepare for the incoming Biden administration.  But Cornyn, like most Senate Republicans, would not refer to Biden as "President-elect," saying the matter will be resolved on December 14 when electors meet in their state capitols to cast their ballots to make official that Biden is the winner. "I really don't feel the need to comment anymore on this," Cornyn said when asked about Trump's conspiracy theories. "I don't think that's very productive." Indeed, many Republicans -- weary after four years of being asked to respond to Trump's controversies and scandals -- said that the fact that the transition is formally underway is more important than pushing back against Trump's false claims that the election was rigged and speaking out against his brazen efforts to pressure state officials to overturn the will of voters. Senate Majority Whip John Thune, asked why Republican senators are not speaking out against Trump's rhetoric, said: "Well I mean I think the important thing for us is the transition is moving forward, and he has authorized that, which I think suggests at least that he understands where this is headed." But Trump has shown little willingness to publicly accept the results of the election, even as six critical battleground states have certified Biden as the winner. While he said last week he would leave the White House on January 20 if he loses the vote in the Electoral College, Trump also has shown no signs of letting up his stream of conspiracies -- ranging from false claims of Dominion voting software switching votes to Biden and saying without evidence that Biden didn't receive 80 million votes. In a phone call with South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham this weekend, Trump vowed to plow ahead despite his failing legal strategy.  "He's gonna fight for every vote and push systems to get better, and I said, 'Keep it up,'" Graham told CNN on Monday evening. "I think he's focused on the challenges he has and trying to, you know, deal with mail-in voting and I'm very worried about it too myself quite frankly." Asked if he thinks Trump should attend Biden's inauguration in January, Graham said: "If Biden ends up winning, yeah I think so. I think it's good for the country, it'd be good for him. We'll know in December." But Graham quickly added: "I hope Biden will come to his."  Murkowski and Romney remain minority voices among RepublicansA few Republicans say they've seen enough. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican who has been critical of the President, called on Trump to concede.  "I think he should concede, I think the race is over," Murkowski told CNN as she was departing the Senate floor Monday evening. Asked if she voted for Trump in the elections, Murkowski wouldn't say. "I don't think that's the pertinent question of the day." Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, the lone GOP senator to vote to convict Trump in his impeachment trial this year, called Trump's attacks on democracy "dangerous." "I think making serious accusations of fraud and an election theft without seriously presenting evidence of substantial fraud is irresponsible and dangerous," Romney said Monday night. But those concerns remain few and far between among Senate Republicans. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, asked if GOP senators should speak up, said: "Well I mean I think that, if your question is should we be criticizing him, then I think what you're getting at in my view is that the President has every right to present his case in every court that he wants to go to and has every right to be heard. And I think we are going to have to look at the effect of mail-in balloting." Asked if he thought the election is rigged, as Trump claims, Hawley said: "I mean we'll see. We'll see at the end when all of the legal challenges are resolved and see when all the evidence has been produced." Impact on Georgia runoff?Others took little issue as well -- especially ones who have a close eye on what's happening in the Georgia runoff races. If Republicans hold one of the two seats, they will remain in the majority for Biden's first two years. As Trump attacks Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and the GOP secretary of state for certifying Biden's win there, Republican senators seemed to take little issue, even as Trump prepares to rally voters there on Saturday. "Oh goodness -- I think no one in Georgia or no one in Indiana is really talking about that," said Sen. Todd Young, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, of Trump's attacks on the governor and election officials.Asked if he had any concerns about Trump attacking the integrity of the elections, Young said: "People aren't talking about that. I'm concerned what people are talking about -- and they're not talking about that. I'm concerned about making sure we fight off the far left of the Democratic Party."  (CNN) - The team at Jet Test and Transport runs a global airline -- but the planes fly on a one-way trip without passengers or cargo. They are experts in ferry flights, moving empty aircraft around the world.In the age of Covid-19, with airlines parking and shedding jets, co-founder Steve Giordano and his pilot partners are some of the busiest guys in the sky.About half of the world's fleet of more than 20,000 commercial aircraft are leased to airlines. At the end of a multi-year lease, an airline may decide to re-up or return the plane to the lessor. That is where Jet Test and Transport comes in.Aircraft leasing has been booming business. Unlike a commercial real estate developer's building, or space rented in a mall or office building, if business goes sour, the aircraft can be reclaimed and sent to another operator. It is, by definition, a mobile asset."When an aircraft is returned [from an airline] at the end of a lease, we'll transport the aircraft either to the next customer, or into storage or into maintenance," says Giordano in an interview with CNN Travel. "That's about half of the ferry work. And the other half is the opposite -- taking the airplanes out of storage or out of a maintenance facility and to the new operator."Jet Test began operations in 2006, although Giordano began ferrying airplanes a couple of years earlier than that. Following the procedures of an airline, Jet Test is regulated under a Bermudian Air Operators Certificate (AOC), and is structured the same way as a larger air carrier. It even has its own identifier callsign for its flights -- JTN.In fact, Jet Test functions just like a small airline, but with one big difference -- it doesn't have any aircraft.And it's not just Point A to Point B flying for Jet Test, either. As its name suggests, Giordano and his team perform test flights on planes returning to service after maintenance or modification, including planes that started life as passenger jets and were converted to haul cargo, fight fires, or disperse oil spills.Big or small, we fly them all!Airline pilots might spend years flying one type of aircraft, but Jet Test's pilots enjoy flying a plethora of planes.With 80% of his company's 250 annual flight operations devoted to ferry flights, Giordano and his pilots must be checked out, or "type rated," to fly just about any type of airliner, from 37-seat regional turboprops like the De Havilland Canada DHC-8 right up to "The Queen of the Skies," the 400-plus seat Boeing 747.Giordano has 18,500 piloting hours -- the equivalent of more than two years in the air -- with half of his time spent in the McDonnell-Douglas MD-80."When you have 9,000 hours on one type it becomes ingrained. I know where every switch is with my eyes closed."With life at Jet Test, the only thing that is constant is variety -- pilots jump from one type to another."I have 10 type ratings. My partners each have 10 or 11 type ratings, and most of our full-time, contract and part-time pilots each have at least five. We stay qualified across the board on everything," explains Giordano.He flies a lot. And his plans can change minute-by-minute.Giordano told CNN Travel that, over six days in November, he planned to cover more than 31,000 air miles, with about half the distance as a passenger on positioning flights. As a pilot, he ferried a Boeing 737-300 freighter from Phnom Penh, Cambodia to Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and then expected to fly another Boeing, an enormous 777-300ER wide-body passenger jet -- Giordano's favorite plane to fly -- from Mumbai, India to Tupelo, Mississippi.The pandemic hitsWhile the coronavirus wasn't declared a pandemic until March, by the early days of 2020 Giordano had already flown trips in Asia and was "well aware of Covid."As countries tried to slow the spread, international travel restrictions came into place in February, essentially shutting down Jet Test until April."The thing that kept us [going] is that we anticipated a huge demand for aircraft movement into and out of storage. We knew that it was coming. We held our breath for a little while, and waited for that first wave to come, once the lessors started thinking about what they were going to do with their airplanes," he explains.With the huge decline in air travel driven by the pandemic, airports around the world turned unused runways and taxiways into temporary parking space for idled planes. "Since then, the bulk of the work we're doing is taking airplanes that were in short-term storage and transporting them into long-term storage facilities."A place in the sunIn the arid desert in Marana, Arizona, near Tucson, Ascent Aviation operates one of the world's largest aircraft storage, maintenance, and reclamation facilities. The area's dry and hot weather conditions are optimal for keeping parked planes in good condition."We're seeing [aircraft] from all six continents, from multiple customers, all more or less going into long-term storage," says Scott Butler, Ascent Aviation's chief commercial officer. "Between five and eight aircraft per week arrive for storage, without many leaving."With airlines grounding thousands and thousands of unneeded planes, space is getting tight at these desert parking lots. According to Butler, global storage facilities are reaching about 75% capacity."We've got 1,200 acres and we can fit, in theory, about 450 aircraft depending on the different sizes. Right now we've got 350 in Marana, another 70 or so in Tucson, and we're going to be starting up in Roswell, New Mexico next year," says Butler. "In February, we had under 100 aircraft."With Covid's impact on airline employees, Ascent is a bit of a bright spot for furloughed aviation technicians."We've had to increase staffing by 30%, adding a lot of aircraft mechanic jobs to the area and the industry," Butler explains.Ascent might be seeing Covid-related growth, but the decimation of international airline travel along with country-specific Covid policies and procedures has had a massive impact on Jet Test's operations. "My biggest complaint is that there is a complete lack of standardization around the world. By far, the most challenging thing for us has been purely related to travel and travel logistics," says Giordano. "Our dispatchers spend three to four hours each day updating a chart that has every country we go to, every restriction, every requirement, and those things change daily."On his recent trip to Kinasha, the DRC's capital, Giordano reported: "Unsure we're going to fly the 777 because of a visa issue. I'm probably going to send another one of my crews to get that one. May need to head right to Montpellier, France and then to China with an A321 -- or head home and come back to France this weekend."This may all sound like chaos, but it's business as usual for Jet Test.(CNN) - Chicago officials say they shut down a 300-person party early Sunday for violating coronavirus restrictions as the city tries to get its Covid-19 surge under control.The Chicago Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection (BACP) said in a statement that it had conducted 93 investigations over the weekend as part of a task force formed to crack down on large gatherings under the city's Covid-19 regulations.Since October 30, Chicago has banned indoor dining and drinking under state-imposed measures to mitigate the spread of coronavirus. The city said it received a complaint about a party in a basement that happened early Sunday morning."The Task Force issued multiple citations, Cease and Desist Orders and closure orders to The Vault/All Access for throwing a dangerous and unlicensed commercial party with approximately 300 attendees, no social distancing and no face coverings," the BAPC said.The Vault/All Access received nine citations for violating the Covid-19 regulations and five cease-and-desist orders for illegal business activity, according to the release.The city's Department of Buildings also ordered the site closed for "dangerous and hazardous conditions, including no smoke alarms, no carbon monoxide detectors, no fire extinguishers."There here have been at least 13.5 million cases of Covid-19 in the United States and at least 268,045 US deaths from the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally. Cook County, of which Chicago is the seat, has had 304,220 cases and more than 6,500 deaths, Johns Hopkins says.A record-high of 96,039 Covid-19 patients were hospitalized across the US as of Monday evening, according to the Covid Tracking Project.Illinois restrictionsIllinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said at a media briefing Monday that mitigation measures in his state would not be lowered for the next weeks as any Thanksgiving effect was evaluated."The number of patients fighting Covid-19 in our hospital systems statewide still eclipses our spring peak by 23%," Pritzker said. "The dip in Illinois' cases over the last few days comes as we are seeing near record-high numbers of hospitalizations -- meaning that our ability to handle any new surge in Covid patients is still limited. If we are not especially careful right now the surge will overwhelm our state's health care system."Chicago isn't the only city targeting parties in violation of coronavirus restrictions. In New York City, a 400-person party was forced to close over the weekend.The Manhattan bottle club was shut down around 2:45 a.m. ET Saturday after city sheriffs discovered about 400 revelers, the New York City Sheriff's office said.The club, between Manhattan's Midtown and Garment District neighborhoods, violated emergency orders and had no liquor license, the sheriff's office said.Four organizers were charged with "offenses for penal, health, alcohol beverage control laws," according to a tweet from the sheriff's office.(CNN) - President-elect Joe Biden and his transition team are preparing for an early, all-out push to pass an ambitious new stimulus bill, while also drawing up plans for a flurry of executive actions aimed at delivering on campaign promises and undoing the Trump administration's efforts to undermine key government agencies.   Biden will be inaugurated in January with a pressing mandate to confront simultaneous and interwoven public health, economic and racial crises. At the same time, his team will take over the work of spearheading one of the most complicated, politically fraught mass vaccination campaigns in American history.Biden's agenda for his first 100 days in office will, according to both those close to him and outside groups in contact with his top aides, center on two key avenues of action: the passage of a broad economic aid package and, where legislation is not necessary, a series of executive actions aimed at advancing his priorities. Containing the Covid-19 pandemic, launching an economic recovery and tackling racial inequality are his most urgent priorities, transition officials say.The scope of stimulus legislation will likely turn on the results of the Senate run-offs in Georgia in early January, a little more than two weeks before Biden is inaugurated. If either Democrat fails to unseat their GOP incumbent rivals, and the body remains under the thumb of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, Biden's ambitions will be checked from the outset. The immigration legislation Biden said he plans to send to the Congress within his first 100 days would likely be dead on arrival.But sources familiar with internal discussions stressed that getting a grip on the surging coronavirus crisis is far and away Biden's top concern. Until that happens, one of the sources said, the President-elect's wider legislative agenda is likely to take a backseat.The realities of a divided Washington, or one where Democrats hold the slim congressional majorities, mean any big legislative initiative will either need some bipartisan support or demand uniform Democratic backing, further complicate the road ahead. Biden is planning an announcement sometime in December to spell out his priorities to the public, according to a source involved in the plans.Meanwhile, the Trump administration and its allies have sought to plant a minefield of complications for its successor. A Trump nominee slow-walked the formal process for allowing Biden's team to engage with government officials. And Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin demanded the Federal Reserve return unused funds from an emergency lending program to Congress, leading the Fed to issue a rare public protest.The executive optionsBiden has a wider berth when it comes to executive orders.His transition team has spent months thinking through the unilateral actions Biden could take almost immediately upon entering the White House. No final decisions have been made on specific steps, but a transition official said Biden will consider using the many "levers at his disposal."In an interview with NBC News last week, Biden singled out the stimulus package -- and committed to making sure it targets the most vulnerable communities and includes aid to cash-strapped state and local governments."There's multiple things that are going to be taking place at the same time," Biden said. "But the most important thing, I think, is to focus on those folks, who are always, when crisis hits, are the first ones hit -- and recovery comes to last."Health care workers and first responders, he said, should be the first in line to take a Covid vaccine once one is authorized for use and distribution channels open up.But Biden acknowledged that a good deal of his agenda could come to "depend on the kind of cooperation I can or cannot get from the United States Congress."He cited his commitment to send legislation with a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants to the Senate, but also said he was poised to immediately roll back some of Trump's "very damaging" executive actions, in particular those related to the climate.Some of that can be accomplished by fiat, Biden's campaign said before the election, spelling out a series of measures that would bring down emissions, up public investment in clean energy and incentivize private innovation.But the scale of the climate agenda agreed to by the Biden-Sanders "unity task forces" will require legislation, too. How that takes shape remains to be seen -- and, like so many other questions facing the transition, could hinge on the outcome in Georgia.Many leading climate activists have long believed that any significant investment in a transition from fossil fuels will need to be baked into an expansive economic stimulus bill. By this summer, after engaging publicly and privately with Biden's campaign, they came away with a cautious optimism that the President-elect's team was "coming around" to a similar understanding.Some of the most notable early work of the Biden administration-in-waiting, which is coming together at breakneck speed with the rollout of nominees to influential cabinet posts and announcement hires to senior White House posts, will take place outside the Oval Office. Trump officials have gutted or hamstrung agencies whose charters clash with the President's long-running efforts to crush what his former chief strategist derisively labeled "the administrative state."That means an early effort, Biden indicated in his NBC News interview, to rebuild the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA, he said, has been "eviscerated" by Trump.There is also a growing push for the new administration to make an early splash by using executive power to forgive student loan debt. Biden has called on Congress to pass relief to borrowers, but a plan promoted by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren argues that Biden could, with the stroke of his pen, cancel as much as $50,000 per person.The to-do listThe to-do list is a long one: Biden during the campaign pledged to make the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act an early priority. As part of that, he pledged to direct federal resources to combat violence against transgender women, with a specific mind to transgender women of color.He has also assured the labor movement that he would reengage with government workers' unions."On Biden's first day in office, he will restore federal employees' rights to organize and bargain collectively," read the pledge on Biden's campaign website, "and will direct his agencies to bargain with federal employee unions over non-mandatory subjects of bargaining."The shadow of Trump's tenure looms over much of the early Biden agenda.The President has repeatedly leaned on the Justice Department to take up his political causes. Biden during the campaign promised to resurrect the barriers between top elected officials and staff and senior prosecutors.The first step, his campaign said, would come through the issuance of an executive order "directing that no White House staff or any member of his administration may initiate, encourage, obstruct, or otherwise improperly influence specific DOJ investigations or prosecutions for any reason."Anyone from the administration found to be in violation of that code would be fired.A number of Biden's domestic priorities overlap with his desire to reengage with other leading powers on the world stage. His "day one" agenda includes a promise to immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Accord and World Health Organization -- both of which were dumped by Trump.Biden's international climate docket includes the convening of a "world summit" that could potentially build on and seek out more ambitious ground than the what was agreed in Paris.Trying to resurrect the Iran nuclear deal will be a knottier proposition, one made all the more difficult by the recent assassination of country's top nuclear scientist -- a killing Tehran has blamed on Israel.(CNN) - Federal government officials are promising coronavirus vaccines soon -- some even before Christmas -- and states are gearing up to begin vaccinating Americans sometime in December.It almost sounds as if people will be lining up everywhere before New Year's to get a vaccine. But while millions of health care workers may be able to get immunized against the virus before the end of the year, the rest of the population is going to have to wait for months.Healthy adults under the age of 65 and children may well have to wait until late spring or even the summer, depending on how many vaccines get approved, how quickly they can be manufactured and distributed, and how the debate goes over allocation.Here's a look at what to expect from the coming coronavirus vaccination campaign.Who can get a vaccine and when? December
Who might get vaccinated: Health care workers and nursing home residentsDecember is a month for some big decisions. On Tuesday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices meets to vote on who should be the very first to get vaccinated. That will almost certainly be 21 million frontline health care workers, support staff and 3 million residents of long-term care facilities who have been hardest hit by the pandemic.It will be easiest to vaccinate these groups -- they're already in institutional settings and the nursing home residents can get vaccinated at the same time their caregivers are being immunized.This decision is being made even before the US Food and Drug Administration has authorized a vaccine. The FDA has scheduled a meeting of its vaccine advisers -- the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee -- for December 10 to consider emergency use authorization for Pfizer and BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine, and another meeting on December 17 to discuss Moderna's vaccine.The FDA has promised to consider the committee's advice before deciding on any vaccine. The committee is made up of outside experts who do not have a stake in any of the companies making coronavirus vaccines and who are independent of the federal government.FDA officials say their decisions on the vaccines could come days to weeks after the meetings -- it depends on what questions come up.But in the fastest scenario, the FDA could give emergency use authorization (EUA) as soon as next week for Pfizer's vaccine, and the federal government's Operation Warp Speed has promised to start delivering vaccines within 24 hours after that.Potentially, the same thing could happen the following week with Moderna's vaccine.Pfizer and Moderna started making vaccine even while they were still testing it and between them plan to have 40 million doses for the US market by the end of December. Each vaccine needs two doses, given three to four weeks apart, so in theory, while 40 million doses could only fully vaccinate 20 million people, it could get 40 million people started.January Who might get vaccinated: More health care workers, other essential workers like emergency medical technicians, firefighters and policeIf two or more vaccines get approved by the FDA, January might be when discussion really starts on who can get vaccinated and when. Dr. Larry Corey of the University of Washington, who is heading up coronavirus vaccine clinical trials in the US, has said if both Pfizer and Modern get vaccines authorized, they could supply 50 million more doses in January and 60 million more in February and March.That adds up to 150 million doses -- enough to fully vaccinate 75 million people. But there are way more people than that just in the groups tagged as priority groups in the US. The CDC estimates there are 21 million health care personnel, 3 million long-term care residents, 87 million essential workers, 100 million adults with high risk medical conditions and 53 million others 65 and older. That adds up to 264 million people.Several groups of independent experts have weighed in on how to allocate vaccines, including the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine and Johns Hopkins University.They've all laid out basic principles that include protecting the country's health care system, protecting the most vulnerable people, controlling the spread of the virus and being equitable across society.ACIP will need to meet to decide on the details off all these phases.January might include some of the rest of Phase 1 of a four-phase vaccine rollout.Phase 1b is roughed out to include people of all ages with underlying conditions such as diabetes and kidney disease who are at significantly higher risk of dying or getting severely ill from Covid-19. This phase may also include older adults living in congregate settings or crowded conditions.February Who might get vaccinated: More essential workers and high-risk adultsBy February, states may have hit their stride on vaccinating residents. Vaccination campaigns may  move beyond hospitals and nursing homes, rehabilitation centers and other such facilities to pharmacies and medical practices.More vaccines may be authorized or at least ready for authorization by January or February. It's clear that Moderna and Pfizer alone cannot cover the US population. AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax all have vaccines in Phase 3 trials, the last stage before seeking authorization or approval.AstraZeneca is likely to seek US approval by January. Johnson & Johnson has said it will have efficacy data by January or February. Novavax is a little farther behind, but all of these companies will also be producing vaccines while testing goes on and might be adding to the count.MarchIt's possible that the US will still be in Phase 1 of vaccination in March, simply because of the sheer numbers involved. That would include essential workers and people at high risk because of health conditions, so anyone healthy and under 65 who is not an essential or high-risk worker would not be thinking about vaccination yet.AprilIf more vaccines have been approved and brought online, it's possible Phase 2 of vaccination could begin by now. This group has not been decided yet, but Phase 2 might include K-12 teachers and staff and other child care workers, as well as other critical workers such as retail workers and transportation workers. This group could also include people in homeless shelters and all people over 65 who were not already included in phase 1.April is the beginning of the second quarter of the year and CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield told the Senate in August he did not think the general public would be able to get vaccinated until the "late second quarter, third quarter 2021."MayYoung adults and children would have to wait until Phase 3 and that's likely to be May at the soonest -- perhaps June or later, depending on what ACIP decides, what the vaccine supply looks like and how smoothly distribution is going.How much will it cost me? The federal government has promised that any coronavirus vaccine will be provided free of charge to the American public. That would be very unlikely to change under a Biden administration. The federal government has paid $7.76 billion upfront to four companies alone for their vaccines; Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Novavax, and tens of millions more upfront or in options to three other companies to guarantee they can develop coronavirus vaccines.Where will I get it? Hospital and health care workers will get the vaccine at their workplaces. They're already set up to deliver vaccines. So will nursing home and long-term care facility residents and, when the time comes, residents of other congregate facilities such as assisted living and senior living homes. Pharmacy chains and big-box stores are also gearing up to deliver vaccines -- think any place people normally get flu shots, including grocery store pharmacies and, of course, physician offices. School clinics may also be considered, especially in states where community clinics have been installed in schools.Can it make me sick?People who have tested out the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have reported they can sometimes have a kick -- causing soreness at the injection site and maybe a feeling of general malaise for a day or so. Vaccine experts say that's a sign the vaccine is working, causing the immune system to rev up and generate a response. There's not much information about the other vaccines but AstraZeneca, after two scares, says it has recorded no serious side-effects among its volunteers. The FDA and companies will have extensive systems for reporting side-effects.But none of the vaccines being tested for the US market uses even a piece of the real coronavirus, so there is no way they could give you a coronavirus infection. Which vaccine should I get? At first there will be little choice -- both Pfizer and Moderna are providing a new type of immunization called an mRNA vaccine. It's considered especially safe because it does not use a whole virus -- just a piece of genetic material -- and both seem especially effective, providing 95% protection against symptomatic disease.What's not known is how long that protection might last, whether either vaccine protects against asymptomatic disease and whether either stops people from spreading the virus to others.Vaccines coming later might offer harder choices. AstraZeneca's vaccine uses what's called a replication deficient virus to deliver a piece of genetic material from the coronavirus. So does Johnson & Johnson's vaccine. There's not a lot of safety data about these vaccines yet, but some doctors may be reluctant to offer them to patients with compromised immune systems, including those with rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis who are taking immune-suppressing drugs; pregnant women; people taking certain cancer treatments and others.What hiccups might get in the way?All these plans assume the states, which are in charge of distributing vaccines, get some money to do it. So far, Congress has not allocated any money for vaccine distribution. Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, estimated the states need $30 billion to get vaccine distribution plans into place.And a US Government Accountability Office report issued earlier this month found bottlenecks in the vaccine manufacturing process -- not necessarily for the vaccines themselves, but for the vials and the other equipment needed to get vaccines into arms. US vaccine manufacturing has languished in recent decades, plus the pandemic itself has hurt the industry, the GAO found.(CNN) - President Donald Trump and his political operation have raised more than $170 million since Election Day, a person familiar with the matter said -- a massive fundraising haul fueled by Trump's baseless allegations that the election was rigged.The fundraising flowed into the coffers of Trump's joint fundraising committee in less than four weeks thanks to a barrage of fundraising solicitations to Trump's supporters, urging them to donate to an "Election Defense Fund" as the President hyped up conspiracy theories about a stolen election. In reality, an increasingly large share of the funds have helped retire the Trump campaign's debt and fund the President's future political operation via a political action committee.The Save America political action committee, which the President launched less than a week after Election Day, could fund his post-White House political life -- underwriting travel, staff and other functions, even if Trump never seeks public office again.The Trump campaign declined to comment on the fundraising figures. The Washington Post first reported that Trump's post-election fundraising had topped $150 million. One campaign adviser said the fundraising is a big indication that Trump "isn't going anywhere." The adviser said there is already talk of Trump doing some extensive traveling post-presidency, including trips overseas to maintain his visibility. As CNN has previously reported, Trump's campaign has sent hundreds of fundraising pitches in recent weeks with over-the-top claims of election fraud. A recent missive asked Trump supporters to sign petitions to "demand a fair election." Another sought "$5 IMMEDIATELY to DEFEND the Election from the Radical Left."The legal fine print on the appeals, however, shows that 75% of the funds raised, up to $5,000, go to the new leadership PAC, Save America. Only after the $5,000 threshold is met, does any money go into the Trump campaign's recount account.In all, the campaign has sent 400 fundraising emails and another 125 texts between 11 p.m. ET election night and early Tuesday morning.Trump's legal team has waged long-shot legal battles to challenge the election results -- with little success. Two states President-elect Joe Biden won by narrow margins -- Arizona and Wisconsin -- on Monday certified their election results, affirming Biden's victory. The Trump campaign had spent $3 million for a partial recount in Wisconsin.(CNN) - "The Talk" is getting two new co-hosts next season.CBS announced Tuesday that Amanda Kloots and Elaine Welteroth will join season 11.

Coronavirus vaccine breakthroughs are sparking hope for a return in demand for jet fuel and gasoline. And a blue wave did not materialize during the November election, easing fears of a fossil fuel crackdown from Washington.That scenario is persuading investors to pile into beaten-down oil stocks. During Wall Street's blockbuster month of November, six of the top seven S&P 500 stocks were in the oil industry. Occidental Petroleum spiked by a stunning 73%. Devon Energy, Apache and Diamondback Energy climbed by more than 50% apiece.The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF rallied 28%, the second-strongest month since the fund launched in 1998, according to Refinitiv, narrowly missing the record set in May. "Christmas came early for the oil-and-gas industry," said Bob McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group. 'Mother-of-all gut punches'The resurgence makes sense given that US oil prices climbed 27% in November, marking one of the best months ever. (The record was set this past May when crude spiked 88% after crashing below zero the month before).The vaccine announcements by Pfizer and Moderna set off a rush on Wall Street to buy pandemic losers, including small-cap stocks and cyclical sectors such as energy."When people want to put on risk, they go to the most beaten-up sectors first," said Daryl Jones, director of research at Hedgeye Risk Management. "Energy was the most washed-out sector."For context, despite the epic rally in November, the energy sector is still down nearly 40% this year. ExxonMobil, the largest US oil company, has lost almost half its value in 2020.The pandemic set off an unprecedented collapse in energy demand, with millions of Americans stuck at home. Energy profits plunged, job cuts mounted and share prices cratered."For the oil industry, Covid was the mother-of-all gut punches," McNally said.  The hope is that highly effective vaccines, once distributed, will encourage more mobility. And more people flying and driving is a prerequisite for a full recovery in the energy industry. But the energy rally isn't solely about vaccines and reopening the economy.No blue waveInvestors are also breathing a huge sigh of relief that Democrats failed to sweep the election -- an outcome that looked to be in the cards just a few months ago. A blue wave -- on top of a pandemic -- would have been disastrous for the oil industry because Democrats vowed to ramp up regulation to fight the climate crisis. "That's not dodging a bullet," McNally said. "It's dodging a cannonball right at their head." If Democrats had taken decisive control of the US Senate, they would have been primed to pass sweeping climate legislation. The biggest threat to Big Oil would have been stripping tax breaks from the fossil fuel industry."The stars were aligned to take a bite out of the oil-and-gas industry's balance sheet. That now goes away," said McNally.Even if Democrats sweep both run-off races in Georgia next month, control of the US Senate will be a 50/50 tie, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris breaking any stalemates. Drilling restrictions ahead?That's not to say the oil industry is completely out of Washington's crosshairs.President-elect Joe Biden can sign executive orders that will make life difficult for oil companies. During the campaign, Biden explicitly opposed a nationwide ban on fracking, the controversial oil-and-gas drilling technique that climate activists want to shut down. (Harris, during her presidential run, favored a fracking ban.) Biden has proposed a more moderate step: banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waterways. But Biden does want to achieve net-zero emissions by no later than 2050, a goal that would all but require a significant drop in fracking. And then there's OPEC. The crash in oil prices this spring was partially driven by the price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. OPEC and Russia teamed up to enact unprecedented production cuts that successfully revived the market. But that alliance is shaky and OPEC is struggling to decide when to start pumping more. The group was unable to reach a deal Monday, delaying a decision until later this week. If the OPEC reductions unravel, it would put renewed pressure on crude prices and oil stocks. The rise of ESG Bigger picture, the oil industry still has a massive climate problem, one that can't be solved by OPEC, vaccines or the election. With the rise of ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance), investors are putting a premium on companies viewed as solutions to the climate crisis (such as Tesla and solar companies). And they're penalizing ones that are seen as part of the problem. For Big Oil, that means weaker valuations, higher borrowing costs and continued pressure from shareholders pushing them to decarbonize. "It's not smooth sailing ahead," McNally said.Editor's Note: Lincoln Mitchell teaches in the political science department at Columbia University.

Read more opinion at CNN.(CNN) - With Wisconsin and Arizona certifying their states' election results on Monday, there can no longer be any disputing that Joe Biden convincingly beat Donald Trump. There are many reasons for Biden's win. Trump's mishandling of the Covid-19 crisis may have pushed some voters away from him. Similarly, his vulgarity and angry rhetoric may have helped Biden pick up support from educated White voters who had previously voted Republican. And Biden may have been a more attractive candidate to White working-class voters than Hillary Clinton was four years ago. But a closer look at the 2020 election data, particularly when compared to 2016, reveals that another dynamic was central to Biden's victory: the absence of any strong third party candidate. In 2016, Trump received 46.4% of the vote. Four years later, in a much higher turnout election, Trump did slightly better with 47.1% of the vote. The difference between Clinton's 48.5% and Biden's 51.1% was enough to put Biden over the top.However, the data suggests that Biden did not so much take support from Trump as get it from somewhere else. That somewhere else was from voters who voted third party in 2016.Four years ago, 94.9% of voters supported either Trump or Clinton, meaning that around 5% supported a third party candidate, primarily Libertarian Gary Johnson or the Green Party's Jill Stein. No third party candidate won any Electoral College votes, but they won enough support to be dubbed spoilers who cost Clinton the key battleground states that put Trump in the White House. By contrast, the two major party candidates in 2020 got 98.1% of the vote combined, limiting third party candidates to less than 2% of the vote.In 2016 the Libertarian ticket included two former governors, New Mexico's Johnson and Massachusetts' William Weld. They were never going to win, but they had the profile of a legitimate national ticket and Johnson's support for marijuana legalization made him even more high profile. Green Party candidate Stein had run previously and was reasonably well known in far-left circles.This year, the Libertarian candidate was an obscure academic named Jo Jorgensen. Her running mate was Spike Cohen, an online personality and activist. The Jorgensen-Cohen ticket was nowhere near as plausible as Johnson-Weld four years ago.Presidential elections are not won nationally, but in individual states. Trump won the three key Midwestern states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan in 2016; Biden flipped all of them in 2020. In all of those states, the third party vote in 2016 was greater than the margin of Trump's victory. Four years later, support for third party candidates dropped from 6.4% to around 1.5 in Wisconsin, from 5.7 to 1.5 in Michigan and from 4.3 to 1.2 in Pennsylvania. There is no proof that all of those third party voters from 2016 moved to Biden in 2020, but a far left candidate like Stein likely drew more from Clinton than from Trump in 2016. Johnson's support was more complicated, but there is reason to believe he hurt Clinton more than Trump.The 2016 election was not the first time that third party candidacies played major roles in presidential elections. Many believe the Green Party's Ralph Nader tipped the crucial Florida vote in favor of George W. Bush in 2000. In 1992, Ross Perot, running as a kind of deficit hawk centrist, won 19% of the vote, leading many to believe -- although the data is less definitive --  that he made it possible for Bill Clinton to win. A generation earlier, George Wallace ran as a White backlash candidate, got 13.6% of the vote and carried five southern states. In the complex political environment of 1968, when today's political coalitions had not yet been formed, Wallace may have helped Richard Nixon win.Perot and Wallace won many more votes than Johnson or Stein in 2020. Perot pushed concerns about balancing the budget into the center of political discourse. Wallace showed the power of racial resentment politics. By 1972, Richard Nixon was using Wallace's rhetoric to remake the Republican coalition. Wallace's anti-intellectualism and appeal to lower income Whites reemerged in 2016 and 2020 as major themes of Donald Trump's campaigns.There was a moment in the 2020 race when it looked like a strong, if eccentric, third party candidate might emerge in the person of the entertainer Kanye West. Democrats fretted that a celebrity like West could take enough votes from Biden to keep key states like Michigan in Trump's column. Many suspected that the Trump campaign was involved -- something the campaign denied -- with the efforts to get West to run after he had come out in support of Trump at a meeting in the Oval Office. There certainly was good reason why Republicans would have wanted the high-profile West to compete with Biden for the Black vote. West's campaign, however, fizzled out. Ballot access can be expensive and difficult for first-time candidates, and issues like missed deadlines meant West was able only to get on the ballot in a few states, where he received a negligible 60,000 votes. While the failure of any third party to gain traction in 2020 was partly due to the nomination of unimpressive candidates, another explanation may be that voters were less willing to take a chance on no-hopers given the Covid-19 pandemic and the polarizing nature of the Trump presidency. If that polarization remains a fact of American political life -- and we have not seen any evidence to suggest otherwise -- it will remain difficult for smaller third parties to get much support in future elections too.(CNN) - Attorney General William Barr appointed Connecticut US Attorney John Durham to act as special counsel investigating whether intelligence and law enforcement violated the law in investigating the 2016 Trump presidential campaign. Barr made the appointment on October 19 and kept it secret so as not to interfere in the election, according to documents released by the Justice Department on Tuesday.It will extend Durham's investigation, which has produced only one criminal charge of a minor FBI lawyer and no public report, and a top investigator left the effort.The appointment is an echo of the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, whom President Donald Trump and Barr have long expressed their displeasure with after he investigated Russian interference in Trump's 2016 campaign and began his work based on information gathered by the FBI and the  intelligence community. This story is breaking and will be updated.(CNN) - President Donald Trump's associates are making appeals to him in the hopes of obtaining pardons before he leaves office, a source familiar with the matter told CNN on Tuesday. The source said the list of associates broaching the subject of preemptive pardons that would seek to shield those individuals from prosecution includes Rudy Giuliani, who has been leading the President's longshot legal battles to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in his role as Trump's personal attorney. The New York Times first reported that Giuliani is seeking a preemptive pardon. Giuliani has denied discussing a preemptive pardon with the President, telling CNN that the "(New York) Times is completely wrong." He further denied he has talked to anyone at the White House about a pardon for himself.It's not clear what potential criminal exposure Giuliani or other associates are attempting to preempt. But the source familiar with the discussions went on to cite what friends and allies of the President see as hostility from the incoming Biden administration toward Trump associates. "Don't trust the Dems," the source said, describing the pardons being sought as "blanket" protection from future prosecution. The appeals come on the heels of Trump's decision to pardon his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Last week, the President granted Flynn a full pardon, absolving him of charges related to lying to federal agents over his contact with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Flynn's pardon was Trump's second act of clemency related to prosecutions of advisers of the President. Earlier this summer, Trump commuted the sentence of Roger Stone. This story is breaking and will be updated.(CNN) - Despite what President Donald Trump is tweeting and saying publicly in the wake of Arizona and Wisconsin certifying President-elect Joe Biden's victory Monday, Trump sees the scoreboard and understands he has no chance of hanging on to the presidency, two White House advisers told CNN.Asked whether the President realizes that he's been defeated, a close adviser who has been in contact with Trump about his legal strategy said Monday: "Yes, he does."The same adviser told CNN that Trump will continue to pursue his legal challenges until they are exhausted, but that adviser pointed to the certification in Wisconsin and said, "The writing is on the wall." Without the ability to override the results in a combination of states, not to mention even one state, the adviser said Trump's election challenges are obviously doomed.Trump is still sounding as if he could still win because he wants to believe it, the adviser continued. But the adviser added Trump is fully aware that he has lost.Trump has not conceded the election and he still falsely claims that he won, but his administration has approved access to transition materials and national security briefings for Biden and his team.A separate adviser said the President has understood for some time that it is unlikely he will be able to overturn the election results but that Trump simply does not want to say that out loud. Certifying election results is typically a formality, but the process had been the subject of Trump's long-shot attempt to cling onto power. His campaign has unsuccessfully tried to block or delay certification in key states in hopes of overturning Biden's victory through the Electoral College.Those efforts, though, are nearing an end as states continue to certify their results ahead of the Electoral College meeting on December 14.Wisconsin Democratic Gov. Tony Evers formally certified Biden's victory on Monday, signing the paperwork to award the state's 10 electoral votes to the President-elect after a Trump campaign-requested recount in Wisconsin's two most populous counties.Arizona also certified its election results on Monday, awarding the state's 11 electoral votes to Biden and clearing the way for Senator-elect Mark Kelly, a Democrat, to be sworn in this week.Pennsylvania and Nevada each completed their certification processes last week.Republican Gov. Doug Ducey praised the integrity of Arizona's election system after witnessing Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, certify the election results Monday morning, as required by state law. Ducey said he would sign official documentation on Monday and have it hand-delivered to the president of the US Senate, so that Kelly "can be sworn in as swiftly as possible."In several tweets Monday night, Trump accused Ducey of "rushing to put a Democrat in office," making baseless voter fraud allegations and vowing that "Republicans will long remember!"Trump then sent a number of retweets about Ducey, including one that read, "Who needs Democrats when you have Republicans like Brian Kemp and Doug Ducey?" The President has also recently attacked Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, another member of his own party, over fraud allegations.(CNN) - Joe Biden's incoming economic team will shoulder the desperate hopes of millions of Americans who have lost jobs, face eviction from their homes or who are going hungry in a monstrous Covid-19-induced slump.But reviving growth and unemployment after the pandemic may not even be the toughest challenge facing the group, headlined by ex-Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, whom the President-elect will formally nominate Tuesday as treasury secretary.Biden has made clear in his comments on the campaign trail, since he was elected, and in the make-up of his team, that he intends to take a swing at fundamentally reordering the economy in favor of working men and women -- a goal that shows huge ambition but comes with dubious chances of success."This team is comprised of respected and tested groundbreaking public servants who will help the communities hardest hit by Covid-19 and address the structural inequities in our economy," Biden said, summing up his dual mission in a press release on Monday.Biden's agenda for his first 100 days in office will, according to both those close to him and outside groups in contact with his top aides, center on two key avenues of action: the passage of a broad economic aid package and, where legislation is not necessary, a series of executive actions aimed at advancing his priorities. Containing the Covid-19 pandemic, launching an economic recovery and tackling racial inequality are his most urgent priorities, transition officials told CNN.Even before the pandemic, inequalities and blocked social mobility, especially in the post-industrial heartlands of the Midwest and among blue-collar workers, was a defining feature of the politics of the early 21st century.The sense that globalization enriched the affluent but left the less well-off destitute in the wake of the Great Recession was a driving force behind the populist nationalism whipped up by President Donald Trump in his 2016 election win.Biden used his own history of support for working Americans and middle class values to pry swing states such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan from Trump's electoral map on his way to the White House. But his presidency will rise or fall on his ability to narrow inequalities in a nation that spent the last Thanksgiving of the Trump era celebrating the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting the historic 30,000 mark even as long lines of people stretched out at food banks in cities from New York to Dallas as they didn't have enough to eat.In the long term, Biden's team, after two presidencies in which inequality has expanded despite massive economic expansion that has benefited the stocks-owning classes, must prove that vows to lift up the middle class are actually realistic in a globalized world and are more than just slogans flung out by nostalgic politicians on the campaign trail.Forging social change The credentials of many of Biden's new team leave little doubt that the former vice president plans to keep his promises to America's workers and to repay the faith of labor unions that have long backed his political campaigns.Yellen started her professional life as a labor economist and has a reputation for seeking to shield the most vulnerable from the worst economic shocks. Cecilia Rouse, Biden's pick to chair the Council of Economic Advisers, is also a labor economist and has said she turned to the discipline to forge social change.In an article in the journal Democracy in June, Neera Tanden, who Biden has nominated as his budget director, wrote that the pandemic had exposed the "moral distortions" of the US economic system."To fix what is broken and rebuild stronger than before, we need a new social contract for the 21st Century, one that updates the New Deal," Tanden wrote. "It is high time to rethink the relationship -- the basic bargain -- between the individual, companies, and our government."The most immediate test facing Biden's team is an already dire economic situation that will likely be far worse when he takes office on January 20 as the pandemic rages in a fall and winter spike. Its resurgence, closing many restaurants and businesses that had struggled to revive over the summer, likely means the economy will struggle to grow and unemployment will rise during the first quarter.Biden is in a similar position to newly elected Franklin Roosevelt when he waited months (the inauguration was in March in those days) in 1932-33 to tackle the Great Depression as his predecessor President Herbert Hoover -- like Trump in the deepening Covid-crisis -- was overwhelmed by the disaster unfolding on his watch. But unlike FDR, there is no expectation Biden will manage to pass nation-changing legislation to end the economic storm.At best -- if Democrats can somehow win two run-off elections in Georgia in January -- Biden would have a 50-50 Senate with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to throw tied votes his way. A Senate led by the Republican master of inertia, Sen. Mitch McConnell, is the more likely outcome, which would make a large stimulus package more difficult to achieve. There are already signs that the GOP is rediscovering its zeal for budget discipline, after four years of indulging Trump policies that exploded the deficit, which normally happens during downturns, at a time of economic growth.Even a small short-term measure could help millions of Americans hurt by the ebbing of government support from previous stimulus packages that kept small businesses afloat, kept renters in their homes and provided extended unemployment benefits.'Half a loaf' is better than none The Democratic House and the Republican Senate have for weeks been unable to agree on the size or make-up of a new Covid-19 relief support package. Trump's absent leadership hasn't helped.The need is so acute that some Democrats have begun to tiptoe toward unusual criticism of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who argues that Republican proposals do not provide the level or duration of support Americans need.Austan Goolsbee, a senior economic adviser in the Obama administration, told CNN's Manu Raju on Sunday that "the virus really is the boss of the economy" and that there is a risk of a double dip recession."If they have to accept half a loaf, then they should accept half a loaf. And then let's try to get another half of a loaf. But right now is really touch and go, and I wish both sides could see that," he said.McConnell said on Monday that it was still possible that an economic agreement could happen in the final days of the old Congress -- though his remarks also could be interpreted as yet more posturing."Let's hope our colleagues at the top of the Democratic Party can finally hear their own members and stop blocking the common sense, multi-hundred-billion-dollar measures that Republicans have been ready to deliver for months," the Kentucky Republican said.Biden has a history of sealing deals with McConnell and he will take office with the power that attaches to a newly inaugurated president. He will be seeking not just short-term help for the unemployed and shuttered businesses but massive funding for states neglected by the Trump White House. He has ambitious plans for a new test-and-trace system to slow infections. States are asking for millions of dollars to stand up vaccination programs. And by the time that Biden takes the oath of office, many American kids will have been out of school for 10 months -- with education officials still lacking federal help to make their eventual return to class safe.Still, Biden will have the advantage of being able to argue to Congress that a new economic package -- while desperately needed -- will be a bridge to better times that are in the near future, thanks to the highly encouraging news about the effectiveness of vaccines developed under the Trump administration.A more hopeful future While there are long months of suffering, death and economic deprivation to come, the Democrat will at least take office in the expectation that normal life can resume in some form toward the middle of the year. If there is an explosion of pent-up economic demand, he could go into a midterm election year that is often punishing for first-term presidents able to argue he both beat the pandemic and saved the economy.That's when the second, more complicated part of the economic team's job will begin: an attempt to reshape an economy that every President in modern memory has argued is biased against the less well-off but none has managed to rebalance. Given the extreme short-term and long-term impediments to his program and difficult political conditions, Biden probably couldn't have chosen a better candidate than Yellen, who, if confirmed by the Senate, will be the first female treasury secretary.The former Federal Reserve chair is respected on both sides of Capitol Hill, a quality that will be important in forging a new stimulus deal. Her knowledge of and good relations with the Fed will also be useful in maximizing the one-two punch the Treasury and central bank could use to kick start the economy.Yellen's nomination has also been welcomed by some progressives -- an important consideration in keeping the fractious ideological groups in the Democratic Party together.

The views expressed here are her own. (CNN) - As school districts across the country ricochet between fully in-person, hybrid and fully online education, depending on the Covid-19 infection rates, we've learned something important about education: We can protect our society from coronavirus and prioritize schools to yield more effective overall public health.  First, schools are not superspreaders. We know much more now than we did when the pandemic started, how the virus spreads and how to decrease transmission. Emerging evidence in Europe shows schools have not been major centers of transmission of the virus, especially for young children. And public health officials have acknowledged that schools have been among the most prepared institutions.  All schools — public and private — can safely operate in some form or fashion because as child-centered institutions, schools care about safety, know how to follow rules and can implement guidance. And so in the United States — with masking, distancing, cohorting, testing, tracing and all the other measures schools have put in place — we aren't seeing much transmission in schools.Opening schools can also help teachers and staff. Just as you can't drive a car without wheels, you can't run a school without teachers. "The vast majority of our staff did feel it was important for us to get up and running," said Tom Leonard, superintendent of the Eanes Independent School District in Austin, Texas. "Our teachers want to be in the room with kids; they really do. Even with masks, Plexiglas, distancing and tight protocols they want to be with the kids."  Leonard admitted that it isn't easy for all schools to implement the technology and equipment changes, especially since schools need to offer both safe in-person and virtual school options -- 40% of students in his district opted to stay remote for medical or personal reasons and are able to attend class virtually. He said his district plan also allows opportunities for teachers who need or want to be remote. Support for teachersMany schools across the country are working with teachers to make sure that they feel supported, safe and have needed supplies. Yet, I think we can all acknowledge that teachers didn't sign up to be frontline workers who have to sanitize their classrooms to pandemic standards, anymore than they signed up to protect our children from school shootings. Educators are making huge sacrifices to stay safe and teach students in person, and they need the families they teach to support them and follow safety protocols themselves.   Some teachers have said it's unrealistic expectations from parents in many communities that seem to cause them the most stress. "We choose this profession because we care about educating students," said Kris Eisenacher, a high school English teacher in Southern California. Just as many schools finally got into an online rhythm with hotspots and computers for students, teachers are being asked to start over again and switch to in-person or hybrid instruction.  "The hours spent re-creating all of my lessons to make them accessible for my students, responding to e-mails from students and parents, learning new apps — it's not enough, apparently," she said, responding to those in favor of reopening schools."I have to risk my health and perhaps my life to do exactly what I've been doing from home." Open schools for kids' well-beingYet, I think it's well known that in-person education improves health, which means that school closures are hurting physical and mental health.  A recent JAMA Network Open study by Dr. Dimitri Christakis, director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children's Hospital, calculated that "the decision to close US public primary schools in the early months of 2020 will be associated with a decrease in life expectancy for US children."  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed that schools should take priority over bars.  "Close the bars and keep the schools open," Fauci told ABC's Martha Raddatz on Sunday. In order to keep schools open, Fauci said Americans must continue to stop the spread of the virus within the community."Let's try to get the kids back, and let's try to mitigate the things that maintain and just push the kind of community spread that we're trying to avoid," Fauci said. "And those are the things that you know well -- the bars, the restaurants where you have capacity seating indoors without masks.""Those are the things that drive the community spread -- not the schools," he said.Without the routine of school, mental health issues are on the rise. Some 27% of parents reported worsening mental health for themselves, and 14% reported worsening behavioral health for their children, according to a national survey. Visits by children and adolescents to the emergency department for mental health problems increased more than 24% during the pandemic, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "We know from research on the impact of natural disasters on the mental health of children that prolonged exposure to this kind of toxic stress is damaging," said Dr. Sally Goza, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. "Most natural disasters have an end, but this pandemic has gone on for more than eight months and is likely to continue to disrupt our lives for many more. We're very concerned about how this will impact all children."Stopping community spreadSome may argue that closing bars, malls, theaters and other public-facing businesses will decimate our economy and ultimately, hurt students as parents struggle to survive. But in these environments, people are in close quarters and, in relaxed social settings, likely to break rules.  We're aware of far more transmission linked to indoor gatherings such as wedding receptions, bars, restaurants, malls and other non-school-related gatherings. It's not during school that Covid-19 is being transmitted. It's on the days kids aren't in school that they tend to gather without masks.Luckily Covid testing options are expanding through the country. This will play a key role in not only helping teachers and parents feel safer but also will help detect cases before they can spread. Several schools currently doing regular surveillance testing of teachers and students have reported that early detection in a student or teacher has helped to identify and isolate infected individuals before any transmission could occur on campus. Schools are experienced in setting up structured environments and regulating behavior. We know how to keep kids safe at school, and similarly, we know how to protect against Covid-19 with symptom screening, masks, distancing, disinfecting, handwashing and testing. Multiple studies have shown over 80% virus transmission reduction with masks and, when combined with at least 1-meter/3-feet distancing, there is greater than 90% reduction of transmission indoors. Rules and routines help young students thrive, and despite popular belief, kids do follow the rules. Their innate honesty often informs teachers when they report illness symptoms in their home or family travel. In addition, schools have proven to be the perfect setting for contact tracing, as we know where each child sits, their fixed cohort or class and who they play with.  Although surveillance testing and in-house contact tracing could be improved upon with more funding in many areas across our country, the schools who are doing it have it down to a system. A system based in science.If there was any time for a national, strategic, public health effort to curb the spread of Covid-19 and save lives, the time is now. Our children are struggling from missed education, social isolation, lack of mental health services, school breakfast and lunch,  and more. We can't afford to wait any longer.  The United States must establish universal recommendations such as masking, distancing and testing, restricting events and exposures, and bringing case numbers down without sacrificing our children's education, mental health and future.  Perhaps if everyone followed school guidelines, we could flatten the curve.(CNN) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acknowledged Tuesday that a second wave of the coronavirus was compromising Canada's economic recovery and pledged more than $77 billion more in stimulus. "This will be a significant investment to get our economy back on track and it's an investment that will make sure no one gets left behind," he said in a news conference in Ottawa. The program will prioritize young families and other impacted communities, he said, adding that the historic stimulus will be equal to more than 3% of the gross domestic product. Canada's average weekly test positivity rate has soared to more than 7% in the last week of November, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. In an interview with CNN partner CBC, Trudeau said that given the spike in cases in Canada and worldwide, he would continue to ban most non-essential travel to Canada, including maintaining a partial border closure with the United States. "Until the virus is significantly more under control everywhere around the world, we're not going to be releasing the restrictions at the border," Trudeau told the CBC. Canada has reported more than 384,000 coronavirus infections and 12,203 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. (CNN) - Meet Elliot Page. On Tuesday, the Oscar-nominated star of movies like "Juno" and "X-Men: Days of Future Past" shared with fans that they are transgender and identify as non-binary, a term used to describe a person whose gender identity is neither man nor woman."I feel lucky to be writing this. To be here. To have arrived at this place in my life," the actor, who was formerly known publicly as Ellen Page, wrote on Instagram. "I feel overwhelming gratitude for the incredible people who have supported me along this journey. I can't begin to express how remarkable it feels to finally love who I am enough to pursue my authentic self." Page said their pronouns are "he" and "they." In their note, Page said they have been "inspired" by the trans community and thanked them for showing "ceaselessly working to make this world a more inclusive and compassionate place." "I also ask for patience," Page wrote. "My joy is real, but it is also fragile. The truth is, despite feeling profoundly happy right now and knowing how much privilege I carry, I am also scared. I'm scared of the invasiveness, the hate, the 'jokes' and of violence." Upon the release of Page's letter, GLAAD lent its support to the 33-year-old Page. "Elliot Page has given us fantastic characters on-screen, and has been an outspoken advocate for all LGBTQ people," said Nick Adams, GLAAD's Director of Transgender Media, said in a released statement. "He will now be an inspiration to countless trans and non-binary people. All transgender people deserve the chance to be ourselves and to be accepted for who we are. We celebrate the remarkable Elliot Page today." Page most recently starred in Netflix's "The Umbrella Academy." "To all trans people who deal with harassment, self-loathing, abuse and the thread of violence every day: I see you, I love you and I will do everything I can to change this world for the better," Page concluded. (CNN) - Bill Cosby's legal team is set to argue in Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Tuesday that two key decisions in his criminal trial were wrongly decided.Cosby, 83, is more than two years into a 3-to-10-year sentence at a prison outside Philadelphia for drugging and sexually assaulting a former Temple University employee at Cosby's home in 2004.Since his conviction in 2018, his attorneys have said they will appeal the case, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in June granted him the ability to appeal two issues.One issue focuses on the "prior bad act" witnesses who testified about alleged assaults that were not part of the charges. The second issue focuses on the prior district attorney's decision not to charge Cosby a decade ago.The charges in the criminal case centered on allegations from Andrea Constand, the former Temple employee who testified Cosby drugged and assaulted her. But at his criminal trial, Montgomery County Judge Steven O'Neill allowed five other women, including supermodel Janice Dickinson, to testify that Cosby had incapacitated and assaulted them in other incidents. Prosecutors said these "prior bad act" witnesses showed Cosby had a pattern in his assaults. Cosby's legal team has argued that their testimony was old and different from the criminal accusations and should not have been allowed in court.In addition, the trial featured Cosby's deposition in a civil lawsuit in which he admitted that he procured Quaaludes for women he wanted to have sex with.Cosby's attorneys have argued that he only answered deposition questions because Bruce Castor, the district attorney at the time, promised to never bring a criminal case based on the allegations.Both parties are expected to present their arguments to the court on Tuesday, but a ruling is not expected for months.
