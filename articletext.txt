(CNN) - More than 9 million people have voted early in the key state of Texas, surpassing the state's total turnout from the 2016 general election, with one more day of in-person early voting remaining Friday ahead of Election Day. Texans cast 8.96 million ballots in the 2016 election.  The high turnout this election so far accounts for more than half -- 53% -- of registered voters in the Lone Star State. The number of total registered voters has grown 12% since 2016 -- almost 1.9 million people.  Nearly 433,000 people went to the polls on Thursday to cast their ballot, bringing the total of in-person votes to over 8 million, according to the Texas secretary of state's website. Mail-in ballots, which continue to flow in from all over the state, account for over 947,000 votes so far. This is a breaking news story and will be updated.(CNN) - President Donald Trump on Friday baselessly claimed that doctors are inflating the coronavirus death count for monetary gain while cases, hospitalizations and deaths surge across the country. "Our doctors get more money if someone dies from Covid. You know that, right? I mean our doctors are very smart people. So what they do is they say 'I'm sorry but everybody dies of Covid,' " Trump said, without citing any evidence, at a rally in Waterford Township, Michigan.There is no evidence for the President's claim and the statement represents a stunning attack on medical workers as the country faces its worst public health emergency in more than 100 years. As of Friday evening, more than 90,000 Americans have been diagnosed with Covid-19, a new daily high, and at least 929 deaths have been reported, according to a count from Johns Hopkins University. Two states, South Dakota and Wyoming, reported their highest daily death tolls on Thursday.Medical experts have long predicted that the fall and winter would bring spikes in coronavirus cases as temperatures dropped across the country and people began spending more time indoors, where the virus can more easily spread. The country is now experiencing that spike -- the five days with the most reported Covid-19 cases have all come in the last week.There is no evidence that suggests hospitals or doctors are inflating their coronavirus numbers. According to new research published this month, there were 20% more deaths from March 1 through August 1 than normally would be expected.  The American Medical Association, without naming the President, condemned claims that physicians inflate the number of Covid-19 patients they treat -- calling such rumors "malicious, outrageous, and completely misguided.""The suggestion that doctors -- in the midst of a public health crisis -- are overcounting COVID-19 patients or lying to line their pockets is a malicious, outrageous, and completely misguided charge," Dr. Susan Bailey, president of the American Medical Association, said in a written statement."Throughout this pandemic, physicians, nurses, and frontline health care workers have risked their health, their safety and their lives to treat their patients and defeat a deadly virus," Bailey added.During his campaign stop, Trump claimed that other countries attribute deaths among coronavirus patients with underlying conditions to other factors, but in the United States, doctors choose Covid-19 because they get additional funds."In Germany and other places, if you have a heart attack, or if you have cancer, you're terminally ill, you catch Covid, they say you die of cancer, you died of heart attack. With us, when in doubt choose Covid. It's true, no, it's true. Now they'll say 'oh that's terrible what he said,' but that's true. It's like $2,000 more so you get more money," Trump said. RELATED: CDC official affirms coronavirus deaths really are coronavirus deathsHowever, if someone who has a pre-existing condition gets Covid and then dies, their cause of death would be Covid-19. Even if that person could have eventually died from the pre-existing condition -- for example, heart disease -- coronavirus will have been what killed them and would be determined as their cause of death. "The underlying cause of death is the condition that began the chain of events that ultimately led to the person's death. In 92% of all deaths that mention Covid-19, Covid-19 is listed as the underlying cause of death," Bob Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said last month in a statement provided to CNN.It's not the first time that Trump has baselessly questioned the accuracy of the US Covid-19 death count."We report them and you know -- doctors get more money, and hospitals get more money. Think of this incentive," Trump said last Saturday. "This country and their reporting systems are really not doing it right."Washington  (CNN) - Election night will be an unusual experience this year. Early results that pop up shortly after the polls close might look very different from the final outcome, because of unprecedented levels of mail-in ballots and early voting due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, supporters of Democratic nominee Joe Biden have shown a strong preference for mail-in voting. Most of President Donald Trump's supporters say they want to vote on Election Day. States count these different types of votes in very different ways. As a result, in some of the most competitive states, early results may look too rosy for former Vice President Joe Biden, before falling back down to earth and becoming more representative of the true outcome. In other states, Trump could see early leads that slowly narrow as more ballots are counted. This won't be a sign of fraud or irregularities. Rather, it's just a reflection of how states count votes. Some states process early ballots first, and will report those early in the night, while others save them for last. Here is a breakdown of what to watch for in the pivotal states. Likely shift from red to blueSome people call this the "red mirage" or the "blue shift," where early results favor Trump but later ballots even things out and might even put Biden ahead once all the results are tallied. This dynamic is expected in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where they don't process absentee ballots before Election Day. Early waves of results will likely come from ballots cast on Election Day and from outside the state's population centers, which are expected to favor Trump. As absentee ballots get counted late on Tuesday night and bigger cities report more of their votes, or even over the days that follow, the statewide vote count could shift in Biden's direction. Experts also believe this will occur in Michigan. A bipartisan deal gave local officials an extra day to process absentee ballots before Election Day, which helps but is not enough time to ensure a robust vote count on election night. State officials have warned that it will take days.Similarly, in Minnesota, there might be a "red mirage" that misleadingly looks like a Trump lead. Minnesota was one of the closest states Trump lost in 2016, and he hopes to flip it this year, though he is lagging in the polls.Likely shift from blue to redSome people call this the "blue mirage" or the "red shift." This is when the first waves of results disproportionately favor Biden, only to be followed by more Trump-friendly ballots later on. This is most likely to occur in the states that start processing mail-ballots weeks before Election Day. The most critical states where experts believe this will happen are Florida and North Carolina. Election officials in these states say the first results to become public after the polls close will be large batches of absentee ballots and in-person early votes, which have been quite favorable to Democrats. As the night drags on, Election Day ballots will trickle in, helping Trump's margins. This dynamic is also expected in Texas, Ohio and Iowa, largely for the same reasons. They'll quickly post results from the historic levels of pre-Election Day voting, which likely helps Biden. This is also likely to happen in Nevada, which is doing things differently this year. Nevada automatically mailed ballots to all registered voters, though in-person voting is still an option. Situation unclear or no expected shiftThe situation is murkier in some of the other key states. In Georgia, some counties will report large chunks of absentee ballots quickly after the polls close, but other counties won't right away. It's unclear exactly how this will shake out on election nightArizona saw drastic post-election shifts in the 2018 Senate race. Officials took steps to avoid that this year, and the count is expected to be faster. There might be less of a delay between posted results from absentee ballots and Election Day ballots, reducing the threat of a "mirage."  Additionally, in New Hampshire and Maine, local officials will blend absentee ballots and Election Day ballots before the results are released, eliminating any "shifts." These states favor Biden, but there is a tight race to win one electoral vote in Maine's 2nd Congressional District. (CNN) - The president of an international think tank has resigned following revelations that he accepted a loan from accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein and secured $650,000 in donations from foundations linked to Epstein for the peace organization.The International Peace Institute, based across the street from the United Nations, announced that diplomat Terje Rød-Larsen had apologized to the institute's board and resigned as president and CEO on Thursday.The IPI said it was unaware of the Epstein transactions.Larsen was a key broker of the 1990s Oslo Middle East peace accords and represented the UN on several peace assignments around the globe.The United Nations announced Friday it has withdrawn from its role as honorary chair of the IPI, following the resignation of Rød-Larsen.Citing the office's independence and status, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the UN secretary-general, after a review, has decided not to serve in any capacity in the governance of any outside entity.The institute is an independent organization that promotes UN causes. It was founded 50 years ago with the assistance of former UN Secretary-General U Thant.IPI board Chairman Kevin Rudd, the former Australian prime minister, denied IPI was aware of the Epstein-related donations or the personal loan to Larsen until media reports in the veteran diplomat's home country of Norway. Rudd said in a statement he was "blindsided.""Mr. Rød-Larsen has apologized to the Board for what he has described as his grave error of judgment, Rudd said. "I am deeply disappointed that the Board has had to learn about so much of this through the media."In a separate statement, the IPI board said, ''Epstein's crimes were hideous. The notion that IPI would be in any way engaged with such an odious character is repugnant to the institution's core values."  Earlier this month, the Norwegian Business Daily (DN) published a letter from Larsen to its board and supporters, a letter since confirmed to CNN, in which he writes, "Please accept my sincere apologies for any distress or embarrassment this may have caused you. DN has reported that I took out a personal loan of $130,000 from Mr. Epstein in 2013. This loan had no connection to the activities or finances of IPI, and it was repaid in full as promised within the allotted time from my own personal accounts."Rudd said the media reports in November 2019 were the first notice of Epstein involvement with the Institute.Rudd said "subsequent searches by IPI staff, made at the request of the Board, have identified donations totaling $650,000 that were received between October 2011 and May 2019. This represented approximately 0.9% of IPI's total revenue over those years. The source of these donations had not previously been disclosed to the Board, nor to me as Chair."  There has been no link established between Larsen and any of Epstein's criminal activities. However the institute is asking for an investigation.In his letter, Larsen writes that "IPI never paid any money or compensation of any kind to Jeffrey Epstein. This was a completely separate and personal matter. I recognize that it was a grave error of judgment on my part to engage in a personal financial relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, and I regret it whole heartedly."The institute said an amount equivalent to Epstein's donations will be given to programs that help victims of human trafficking and sexual assault. The board has named Adam Lupel, the IPI's current vice president and chief operating officer, as the institute's acting president and CEO.Rudd said he attended an international event including UN Secretary-General Ban-Ki Moon and other dignitaries in September 2013 where it was later determined Epstein was on the guest list, though it's not certain he attended.Rudd said he does not remember meeting him nor does he recall Epstein joining an advisory panel conference call in January 2014 designed to provide mining advice to Mongolia.The IPI said it will commission a global accounting firm to audit its finances to make sure that all Epstein foundation donations have been identified.Epstein was indicted on sex trafficking charges in New York in 2019 and found dead in his jail cell in Manhattan weeks later.Larsen is married to Mona Juul, Norway's ambassador to the United Nations.Initial efforts to contact Larsen have been unsuccessful.Washington  (CNN) - The fight for the roughly 32 million eligible Latino voters is on, despite the relatively meager attention this bloc has received.With Election Day just five days away, Latino voters are expected to be consequential in states including Florida and Arizona. In fact, President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden held dueling events in the Sunshine State on Thursday. And Trump held two rallies in Arizona on Wednesday.But don't mistake Latino voters for a monolith.According to CNN's Poll of Polls, Biden has a slim lead over Trump in both Florida and Arizona. But in Florida, the polls offer a mixed picture of Biden's standing among Latinos. Trump has an advantage of 52% to 46% with the state's Latino voters, a new NBC News/Marist poll shows, while recent polling from Quinnipiac University and Monmouth University puts Biden ahead with the group. Cuban voters make up a healthy portion of Florida's Latino population, and they tend to vote Republican.Meanwhile, it's possible that Latino voters in Arizona, which the Republican presidential nominee has won in every election since 1952 save for one, could deliver the state to Biden. Arizona's Latino voters are much more likely to be from Mexico or elsewhere in Latin America. A big push from this group, which tends to favor Democrats, would complicate Trump's quest for reelection. A recent CBS News/YouGov poll puts Biden's advantage with Arizona's Latino voters at 61% to 33%."Whoever wins the Latino vote is going to win Maricopa County. And whoever wins Maricopa County is going to win Arizona," Joseph Garcia, the director of the nonprofit Chicanos Por La Causa Action Fund, told The Guardian. "And whoever wins Arizona is likely to win the White House."Over the past several days, Trump has pushed to gain the backing of Latino voters in key states -- but through characteristically vague and anemic appeals, as my CNN colleague Maegan Vazquez wrote of his "American Dream Plan" for Latino communities.Crucially, while Latino voters are a Democratic-leaning bloc, that doesn't mean that the former vice president hasn't been facing challenges on this score. Compared with Hillary Clinton in 2016, Biden is winning Latino voters by fewer points in preelection polls. His campaign also has received criticism for reaching out to these voters later in the game.To discuss the battle for Latino voters -- what it looks like, what lessons it offers for the future -- I spoke with Democratic California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who from 1993 to 2017 was a US representative from California. During his tenure, he was a visible member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.The following conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.There's long been this notion that Latino voters are the "sleeping giant": a politically inert bloc with massive potential. But these days, the term seems too simple and timeworn, as many people are pointing out. What are your thoughts on how we, as a society, tend to characterize -- even mischaracterize -- Latino voters?More and more, the Latino community is becoming familiar with being American. You're seeing more and more integration and participation in the things that we sometimes take for granted as Americans.My parents have always voted, though they were new voters. As an immigrant, you become a new voter after you become a citizen. What you're finding is that the experience their generation had to go through to understand the process is very different today, when there are programs to help people become citizens, to learn what it means to exercise their rights as citizens.So participation is growing. More and more, you're finding that the Latino community, like other communities, is becoming active. And honestly, it's being driven not by very seasoned people but by young people, a trend that bodes well moving into the future.Could you talk a little bit more about young Latino voters? It sounds like there's an interesting shift taking place.You're seeing that younger voters are more cognizant of the circumstances of the vote -- what it means.Quick example. There are hundreds of thousands of young Latinos who are Dreamers and can't vote. But I guarantee that they're active on the campaign trail, and for a righteous reason: They can't help themselves to a vote, so they're going to reach those who can. They have many friends who do have the right to vote. And these friends don't understand why they can vote but others can't, and they've become politically active because they see the injustice visiting their peers.So it's activism that comes from a personal experience and that maybe a generation ago wasn't as salient. This activism has always sort of been there -- the whole issue of immigration. But now it's so salient because Trump, in trying to repeal the DACA program and in being so frontal in his assaults against immigrant families -- has made it very personal. Activism has taken on heightened importance for many but especially for the younger generation.What about Biden? What are some of the challenges that the campaign has been confronted with regarding Latino voters -- it's gotten some flak for seemingly neglecting them -- and how has the campaign sought to overcome these challenges?Remember that there were many candidates early on during the Democratic primary, and it was difficult for Biden to break through. There was a point when a lot of the resources for the Biden campaign had been exhausted. But then all of a sudden when he caught fire and it became clear that he'd be the nominee, he had to play catch-up, compared with the Trump campaign, in terms of resources and being able to reach out.But what the Biden campaign has done is dramatic. It has 11 Latino vote directors throughout the country. It has multiple state directors who are Latino. It has what it calls Latino leadership councils that essentially help bring together the community to understand what's at stake.And all that is complemented by a platform that's related to the interests of the Latino community. Without question, Biden can say when he takes office as president that he has the most ambitious agenda for the Latino community of any person who's taken that office.The blow that the pandemic has dealt to Latinos is staggering: More than 25,000 have died from Covid-19. Latino voters are no monolith, but what are some of the chief issues on the ballot for this bloc?It always surprises people when I say this, but the reality is that when you poll in the Latino community, chances are the top three issues for Latinos are going to be the same top three issues you see in America writ large: jobs, health care, education. The intensity may vary slightly, but it's largely the same.Americans, regardless of their background, are most concerned about their jobs, about having the wherewithal to provide. And that certainly plays out more intensely among Latinos because, generally, we're not a wealthy community.What I can tell you is this. Anyone who can speak to providing for families is going to have an in with Latinos. Anyone who can offer security when it comes to health care is going to have an in with Latinos. Anyone who believes in offering a path to real educational opportunity is going to have an in with Latinos.If you take a look at the two presidential nominees, you'll see that Biden's message resonates far more than Trump's. Because while Trump likes to say, "Things are great. The economy is moving forward," he forgets that most Latinos don't work on Wall Street. In fact, he forgets that the very essential workers whom he insists go to work and not have protections are, for the most part, Latinos.Trump is so out of touch with the needs and interests of Latinos that it doesn't take much for Latinos to see the difference between what he's offering and what Biden is offering. I haven't even gotten to the harmful way Trump speaks about Latinos. Many people can disregard that kind of talk if they're doing well, but Covid-19 has illustrated that Trump really doesn't care about workers, in particular Latino workers.Anything else you want to add, maybe about what observers should keep an eye on in the future?I'll just say that growth in civic participation is becoming more evident within the Latino community. I remember being interviewed in 2015 or 2016 about how there weren't enough Latino leaders in elected office, yet political parties kept saying that Latino voters ought to go with them, though the parties weren't giving Latinos opportunities to be in the highest posts.Five or 10 years ago, there weren't too many statewide elected officeholders in California who were Latino. Today, you don't have to look very far. You're beginning to see that Latinos are reaching those higher posts.And so growth takes a while. But once it starts, it keeps going. And anyone who ignores that -- who doesn't realize that this is a community that's only beginning to taste what it's like to be involved in politics -- does so to their detriment.(CNN) - The big question heading into the final weekend of the 2020 campaign is this: Will we know who won the White House on Tuesday?The answer is that we might know, but it is very unlikely that the election will be called by any TV network or media organization on election night. And there are two major reasons why:1) The 2016 election: While national polling was, largely, accurate about Hillary Clinton's popular vote margin -- she had a lead of 2.8 million in the popular vote -- there's no question that President Donald Trump's victory four years ago was a surprise to, well, almost everyone. And that includes the media organizations that model the election in hopes of being able to call individual swing states for candidates and, ultimately, declare the next president long before all the actual votes are cast.Because of that shock to the political system four years ago based, in large part, on Trump's ability to pull nontraditional voters to the polls, there will be a significant amount of caution exercised when it comes to making both projections about who has won closely contested states and who has won the election.The nightmare scenario for anyone attempting to project the next president is what happened in 2000, when Florida was called and then retracted as more information (and votes) became available. No one wants a repeat of that, particularly given Trump's repeated assertions, with zero facts, that the election is somehow "rigged."2) The massive early vote: Because of a combination of the coronavirus pandemic and a series of states changing their laws to make it easier to vote by mail or early in person (because of the virus), the early vote numbers are historically large. In Texas, for example, more people have already voted early than voted -- both early and on Election Day -- in 2016. We've never seen anything like these early vote numbers, largely because we haven't dealt with a deadly pandemic like Covid-19 in 100 years. Because of the through-the-looking-glass nature of the early vote, it's even harder than normal to produce accurate turnout models on which networks base their projections. Does the increased early vote mean fewer people will vote in person on Tuesday? Or will Election Day turnout soar commensurate with how much early voting has gone up? Somewhere in between?No one -- and I mean no one -- knows the answers to those questions. And that means that the people in charge of calling states (and the White House) are going to be extra cautious when it comes to reading the signs their election models are sending them.Add it all up and you start to understand why staying up super late on November 3 (or very early on November 4) might not mean that you get to hear the identity of the next president.Caution is warranted -- always -- when announcing something as monumental as the next president of the United States. But it's even more important to be cautious when you are making that sort of projection amid a pandemic and with a man in the White House who has made plain his (false) belief that something nefarious is going on in the voting.It's better to be right than first. And that's never been more true than in this election.(CNN) - Carole Catherine did not know her husband, Tim, supported Donald Trump until the day after Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election. She called him the next morning crying."And he was like, 'Yeah, of course she lost. She is an awful human being,' " she said. "It was like a light went off for me. And I thought, 'Oh boy, we're going to have trouble.' "For the next three years, Catherine felt like she was living an alternate reality. Her husband was her high school sweetheart. A rekindled love after a first marriage, children and divorce. They barely fought for the first 11 years of their marriage. And now they were working through major ideological differences."I didn't know that he's anti-abortion. I didn't know that he is so emotional about immigration," Catherine said.  "Both of us never really fleshed out those issues."A place to ventThe same is true for many of the wives who are now part of the private Facebook group Catherine founded last year. The group is called "Wives of the Deplorables," a play on the now infamous comment Clinton made about some of Trump's supporters during her 2016 presidential campaign. Catherine started the group in October 2019 in an effort to try to figure out how to talk to her husband about politics -- without it ending in a yelling match. The group is made up of wives across the United States who are Democrats, whose spouses are Republicans; many of them Trump supporters."So many of them join the group and go, 'Thank God you guys are here,' " Catherine said. "'I'm so glad that I found this place where I can be me and I don't feel like I'm crazy.'"Members mainly congregate on its Facebook page, where they post personal frustrations.One post reads: "There is a big wall between us like never before ... We've been married 45 years and I adore him. Except this. I have GOP friends and I love them. But it's hard to be married to a man who I thought shared the same values."And another: "I am not interested in surviving my marriage. I do not admire sticking it out with a person who is unable to empathize with others. Maybe I am bitter ... but missing out on an intimate part of marriage, like deep conversations and unity just sounds hollow to me. I want a partner to march with, to resist with and one who shared my ridiculously idealistic views!"Others post articles and talk about how to keep the conversation neutral at home:"This was an agreement we made early on: No Fox News, no MSNBC," Gretchen Wisehart told about a half-dozen members in a recent Zoom call. "I do sneak The New York Times and Wall Street Journal online. I fully admit it."Unlike many of the women in the group, Wisehart is no novice to politics. She and her husband, Tom Ellis, have run for local political offices in Pennsylvania. She as a Democrat; he as a Republican. He was a delegate in 2016 for Trump. They were engaged to be married then, but that election nearly put an end to their relationship."For three days she didn't talk to me," Ellis recounted."As someone who marched for the ERA (Equal Rights Amendment) in the '70s with my mom, it really seemed like the culmination of decades of work," Wisehart said. "It was absolutely devastating that it didn't happen.""It was a tough election. But we ended up getting back and getting married. And we're still fighting and fussing about politics," Ellis said.Much of Wisehart and Ellis' relationship is rooted in their love of the US government. They both studied political science at the University of Pennsylvania. And they joke that it's commonplace for one of them to take out their copy of the Federalist Papers to fact check each other."I think we we both understand the American dream. We both believe in American principles. But sometimes we have a difference on how we get there," Ellis said. The marriage divideA 2016 research study found that less than a third of marriages are between people of mixed political beliefs. Among those couples, it was twice as likely for the man to be a Republican and the woman to be a Democrat as the opposite. That divide could be increasing.In the 2020 race, Joe Biden is up by an average of 25 points among women voters. That includes a 34-point margin in a CNN poll released in early October -- the biggest margin in history.White women in particular are distancing themselves from Trump. CNN polls taken since April show that Biden has led among White female registered voters by about 13 points. In comparison, Trump led by an average of five points among White women in the last few months of the 2016 race.Trump has tried to appeal to women on the campaign trail heavily in the last few weeks. At a campaign rally in Lansing, Michigan, Tuesday the President pitched himself as the candidate for suburban women voters because he's "getting your kids back to school" and "getting your husbands back to work."Wisehart said his language was "patronizing, misogynistic and classist," and has the potential to backfire."I'm a suburban woman. I have kids. I go to a job every day. There were a lot of women who voted for him in 2016 as the lesser of two evils. But his constant rhetoric, the way he demeans women, it turns women off. It turns them the other way. I hear it from a lot of people," she said. Wisehart first stumbled upon the "Wives of Deplorables" Facebook group this summer, when it popped up in her feed."When I saw it. I said, 'Yes! This is this is my tribe right here. These women will understand.' "The pandemic effectCatherine has seen membership grow in the last few months, she thinks in large part due to Covid-19: "We're stuck in the house with these guys," she joked.She found Trump's recent comments about suburban women funny, in a way. She says if Trump was really concerned about women, he would have done a better job handling the pandemic back in February. "He's already shown who he is and I don't think any of them are going to change their mind last minute just because he's trying to court them now."Recently, she said, she's felt her husband's feelings about Trump shifting. She recounted one time recently he walked up the stairs during a Trump press conference about the pandemic and asked, "'What's the a-hole-in-chief saying today?""And I was like, 'I LOVE YOU!'""We've had some really good conversations recently where I can tell that we agree on more than I think. And it makes me feel so good."But that doesn't mean things will get any easier for them if Trump is no longer in office. Either way, the past four years has given her a crash course in political consciousness. And she has no intention of giving that up. "He wants things to be pre-politics. But that's the thing. Your relationship has changed forever. For good and for bad. And, you know, there's a little of both."(CNN) - Scientists find some spiders that can hear. A chipmunk gets a fine-dining experience.

It was moved about 200 feet so it could avoid being demolished. (CNN) - It is a truth universally acknowledged that if you live in the US and have a non-English name, someone at some point is bound to butcher the pronunciation.People across virtually every ethnic group have had to deal with others struggling to get their names right. And the problem seems to persist no matter how powerful or visible a person becomes.Take Wednesday's Senate hearing with top tech executives, among them Google CEO Sundar Pichai.Despite the fact that Pichai runs one of the world's most powerful companies and that he had testified on Capitol Hill before, senators still couldn't seem to pronounce his name correctly -- instead calling him variations of "Mr. Pick Eye" and Mr. Pish Eye." (It's pronounced "pih-CHAI," like the spiced beverage.)Then there was Sen. David Perdue's handling of the Democratic vice presidential nominee's name earlier this month during a rally for President Donald Trump. The Georgia Republican referred to his colleague, Sen. Kamala Harris, as "Ka-ma-la or Ka-ma-la, Kamala-mala-mala," punctuating that with "I don't know, whatever."(Harris has served in the US Senate for almost four years and pronounces her name "COMMA-la," like the punctuation mark.)Continually mispronouncing someone's name is lazy at best and malicious at worst, as many people have been quick to point out. And too often, the names that are regarded as "too difficult" to learn belong to people of color.To paraphrase what actress Uzo Aduba said her mother told her growing up, "If they can learn to say Tchaikovsky and Michelangelo and Dostoyevsky," people can learn to say Sundar Pichai and Kamala Harris.Ultimately, expert say, the issue boils down to power and respect.Botched names are often tied to raceEncountering unfamiliar-sounding names is inevitable in a country as multicultural as the US, and stumbling a few times at first is normal.You might recall how many Americans tripped up over the name of former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg (it's pronounced "BOOT-edge-edge"), prompting his husband to tweet several phonetic pronunciations.Non-English names, naturally, employ stress patterns or sounds that aren't used in English, and remembering those sequences can be challenging, says Megha Sundara, a linguistics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.The issue, though, isn't unintentional mistakes, but rather how people recover from them."You can double down out of embarrassment, or apologize and fix it," Sundara wrote in an email to CNN. "Because 'say my name' is perhaps the most basic way in which we ask others to acknowledge our existence."So when someone doesn't take the time to learn the proper way to pronounce another person's name -- or worse, intentionally mocks it for being "too hard" to pronounce -- it can come across as malicious.It also evokes the nation's history of dominant groups forcing new names on people of oppressed groups, such as enslaved Africans and indigenous children in government schools, says Rita Kohli, an associate professor of education at the University of California, Riverside."There is a longstanding history of forcible assimilation in this country as a way to maintain the power structure," she wrote in an email to CNN. "To ensure that White Anglo Saxon, English, Protestantism stayed dominant, those who did not fit were made to change things such as their language, their names. It has created a culture where those who are dominant have not had to engage in reciprocal relationships of learning."That dominant groups dismiss certain names as too hard to get right is tied to racism and other forms of oppression, Kohli added.Perdue's derisive mocking of his fellow senator's name amounted to "disrespecting and deprofessionalizing a Black and woman of color vice presidential candidate," Kohli said. (A spokesperson for Perdue's campaign has said that he simply mispronounced the name and didn't mean anything by it.)"One thing is for sure, if you have known somebody for a long time, and are still saying their name wrong, guess who has power in that relationship?" Sundara added. "It's not the person who can neither correct you nor make it stick."Some children of immigrants adapted their names to make them 'easier'Having others constantly mess up your name can be so exhausting that some people with non-English names decide to adapt or change them.One way is by adopting an Anglicized pronunciation.For example, many South Asians pronounce Kamala, a common Indian name, as "come-luh" or "come-uh-luh.""People ask me how to pronounce it. There are many ways," Harris said in a 2017 interview with David Axelrod. "If you were asking my grandmother, she'd say 'come-luh.' I usually help people pronounce it by saying, 'Well, just think of a comma and add a "-la" at the end.'"Others, like Mindy Kaling, shorten their given names.The actress, whose birth name is Vera Mindy Chokalingam, told NPR's Terry Gross that when was performing standup comedy early in her career, emcees had trouble pronouncing her South Indian last name -- so she shortened it, even though she had mixed feelings about the decision."It's bittersweet, but I have to say, it was such a help to my career to have a name that people could pronounce," she said in the interview.And then there are some who choose to go by a different name altogether, like former Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal. Jindal, whose parents immigrated from India and who was born with the name Piyush, began going by the name Bobby as a boy because he identified with a character in "The Brady Bunch."But some people are pushing backBut many people of color are no longer willing to accommodate the dominant, White culture at the expense of their own heritage.Last year, comedian Hasan Minhaj appeared on Ellen DeGeneres' show and refused to move on during a segment until the TV host pronounced his name correctly."When I first started doing comedy, people were like, 'You should change your name,'" he said on the show. "I'm like, 'I'm not going to change my name. If you can pronounce Ansel Elgort, you can pronounce Hasan Minhaj.'"Harris, too, has insisted that people get her name right, tying her experiences to what so many others go through."That the highest elected leaders should conduct themselves like they did when they were children on the playground, it speaks poorly of their appreciation for the responsibility of the role that they have," she said on The Daily Show. "And I think it's a reflection of their values and their maturity."(CNN) - Appearing on Laura Ingraham's Fox News show Thursday night, Donald Trump Jr. was asked about Dr. Sanjay Gupta's recommendation that anyone who attends a campaign rally for the President self-quarantine for two weeks.  He responded this way (bolding is mine):"I mean, give me a break, Laura, the reality is this ... if you look, I put it up on my Instagram a couple days ago, because I went through the CDC data because I kept hearing about new infections, but I was like, 'Well, why aren't they talking about deaths?' Oh, oh, because the number is almost nothing."The number is 1,004. As in, 1,004 Americans died of coronavirus on Thursday. That's 1,004 people with families, friends and colleagues who will never get to talk to them, hug them or see them ever again.And those 1,004 are now part of the 228,000-plus Americans who have succumbed to the virus since it appeared in the United States in early spring. That number isn't "almost nothing." It's almost four times the number of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. It's almost double the number of Americans killed in World War I. And it's 228,000-plus families whose lives will never be the same.That Donald Trump Jr. doesn't seem to grasp that reality -- or doesn't care -- is, in its way, perfectly fitting. From the start of the pandemic, President Donald Trump has purposely downplayed the threat posed to Americans by the virus, pushed quack cures, insisted -- contra facts -- that the country is "rounding the corner" on the disease and promised a vaccine that has yet to arrive.On Thursday, hours before his son made his own insensitive comments about the virus' mortality rate, the President himself did the same."You know the bottom line, though?" Trump told a Florida rally crowd. "You're gonna get better. You're gonna get better. If I can get better, anybody can get better. And I got better fast." (Read this for all the reasons that's not true.)And that all comes in the same week that this exchange occurred between CNN's Alisyn Camerota and Trump campaign spokesman Hogan Gidley:Camerota: Well, let's talk about acting responsibly. I mean, just again with Wisconsin, are you at all concerned given that there has been an outbreak in the vice president's orbit of people around him and that there is currently an outbreak -- I mean, hospitals in Wisconsin are near capacity. And so is there -- does that give you any pause or the vice president any pause about going there and holding a big rally?Gidley: No, it doesn't. The vice president has the best doctors in the world around him, they've obviously contact-traced and have come to the conclusion it's fine for him to be out on the campaign trail.Right.Gidley added: "The American people have the right under the First Amendment to peaceably assemble, too."This is an administration that sees the entire virus through the lens of the President's political fate. A majority of the country believes he has mishandled Covid-19 and so, in order to win, President Trump needs people to be thinking less about the virus. And he (and his team) believe the way to do that is to minimize the numbers of deaths while making false promises about the current status of the virus.(To be clear: We are not "rounding the corner" on the virus. On Thursday alone, more than 88,000 cases were reported in the United States -- the largest number of cases in a single day since the start of the pandemic in the United States.)The problem with the argument being made by the President and his son -- aside from it being patently false -- is that it endangers Americans. Because if you only listened to Donald Trump and Don Jr., and there are people who do, you would be under the deeply mistaken impression that Covid-19 is not a real threat to you and that, even if you did get sick, you will simply get better.And you might! In fact, you likely would! But more than 228,000 Americans haven't gotten better. And to dismiss their deaths as "almost nothing" is not just tone-deaf, it's heartless.(CNN) - There are lots of reasons that the check engine light could come on in a Ford Mustang, but a big, honkin' snake curled up under the hood is probably not in the service manual.Wildlife officers were called to a business in Dania Beach, Florida, on Thursday morning to remove a 10-foot long Burmese python from the car's engine compartment, according to a post on the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission's (FWC) Facebook page.Maor Blumenfeld said people at the business found the snake when they opened the blue Mustang's hood to investigate the check engine light -- which clearly was not specific enough.Blumenfeld shot video of a wildlife officer grabbing the snake behind the head and then muscling it out of the ground, while another bystander tried to help him get the snake into a bag.FWC spokeswoman Carli Segelson told CNN that agency staff now have the snake and it will probably be used as an education and outreach animal. She said it was probably not seeking a spot to warm up."Since it is still hot in South Florida, the snake was likely not in the car seeking heat," she said.Burmese pythons are not native to Florida and are considered invasive because they prey on native birds, mammals and even alligators, according to the agency.The snakes are not protected and can be killed on private property and on 25 public lands in South Florida. The FWC encourages people to kill wild-caught pythons whenever possible, and to report any sightings to officials.Burmese pythons usually grow to be about 10 feet in length, but a trapper known as the Python Cowboy captured a 17-foot-long specimen in June after a fierce fight in the Florida Everglades.In August, Florida officials announced that they had removed 5,000 pythons from the Everglades.(CNN) - Body camera footage of the moments leading up to the fatal police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr. will be released publicly Wednesday, the day after the national election.  A joint statement released Friday by Philadelphia's mayor, district attorney, and police commissioner and the Wallace family said the timing "is in the best interest of our city and its residents.""Philadelphians are experiencing an immense amount of pain, and significant unrest persists throughout the entire city," the statement said. "The collective hope of our local government and the Wallace family is that releasing the recordings on November 4 will provide enough time to calm tensions and for the recordings to be released in the most constructive manner possible."The statement came one day after Wallace's relatives watched the footage, which family attorney Shaka Johnson said showed the man in an "obvious mental health crisis."The footage, which is about 30 to 40 seconds long, showed Wallace emerging from a house with a knife as family members shout about his mental condition, according to Johnson. The head of the city's police union on Friday called for the release of the footage and 911 audio "so that the city can begin the process of healing" following days of unrest and curfews.   Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #5 President John McNesby, in a statement, said the union's review of the footage and audio showed officers retreated for "nearly 50 seconds" and ordered Wallace to drop his knife "more than 20 times" before shooting. Wallace, 27, was shot and killed Monday while holding a knife during a confrontation with police in West Philadelphia. The shooting and the moments that immediately preceded it were also recorded by a bystander with a cell phone.Wallace's family has said he suffered from bipolar disorder and was in crisis at the time of the shooting."The officers were justified in their use of force under very difficult and stressful conditions, an armed man confronting them with a knife," said McNesby, who noted the officers "followed police department training and protocols."Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said Friday the body cam footage concerned her."I'm quite careful about what I say because I do not know all the circumstances around it as far as what led up to it, what the officers experienced and what they will be saying in their internal affairs interview." she said. "With that said, I would only be speculating right now but what I saw was rather concerning" Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said that the identities of the officers involved in the shooting will also be released on Wednesday.Officials said Friday a citywide curfew will again be in place from 9 p.m. through 6 a.m. There were two arrests in connection with unrest late Thursday and early Friday and 13 looting incidents, according to the mayor's office. The shooting has set off days unrest, with demonstrators marching in the streets and some instances of property destruction and attacks on police officers.  Johnson said officers fired 14 times at Wallace from about a car-and-a-half-length distance away. He said the city had failed the officers by not giving them less lethal options such as a Taser to handle such situations.Wallace's family believes the city failed them, but they are not calling for the officers to be charged with murder, Johnson told reporters on Thursday."And here's why, here's why: They were improperly trained and did not have the proper equipment by which to effectuate their job," Johnson said. (CNN) - Republicans in Florida's most populous county, Miami-Dade, are turning out to vote at a somewhat higher percentage than Democrats -- causing uneasiness among some Democratic operatives.Nearly 63% of the 428,000 registered Republicans in the county have voted so far, whereas about 56% of the county's 634,000 registered Democrats have voted to date, according to state data. About 225,000 people with no party affiliation have also already voted in the county. While more Democrats than Republicans have voted overall in Miami-Dade, the county is seen by Democrats as a region former Vice President Joe Biden must win by wide margins in order to offset voting in the state's predominantly red regions.Democratic worries come as both President Donald Trump and Biden vie for Florida's 29 electoral votes, with each candidate holding a rally there Thursday as CNN's Poll of Polls shows Trump lagging in the state at 46% to Biden's 49%. Politico was first to report the concerns among Democrats.Steve Schale, a veteran Democratic Florida strategist who runs a pro-Biden PAC, said, "I'd love to see Dade County jump up this weekend and I'll feel better if it does." But Schale added that Black voters in the county tend to vote in-person closer to Election Day, so he expects a bump in turnout over the coming weekend. He added that Democrats have had strong turnout in neighboring Broward County.State data show about 61% of registered Democrats in Broward have voted so far compared to about 56% of registered Republicans in the county. Democratic data consultant Matt Isbell said he's seeing a "lagging factor" among Democratic Hispanic voters in Miami Dade. "I don't have a good answer for why that might be. But that is certainly a factor at the moment that is giving Democrats a lot of worry," Isbell said. Like Schale, Isbell said he expects to see an uptick in Black voter engagement in coming days, but he also said the dynamics of this election, with the pandemic and the increase in vote-by-mail, make comparisons to previous election cycles and predictions difficult.Steve Simeonidis, chairman of the Miami-Dade Democratic Party, said he's not concerned. "We're quite confident and quite comfortable from where we are sitting right now. We need to keep working to keep things going but we are in a good place."(CNN) - A New Orleans police officer was shot in the face and another was injured Friday  when a passenger in a pedicab in the French Quarter fired at their vehicle, the city's police superintendent said.The shooting happened Friday afternoon while the officers were on patrol. The officers had no contact with the suspect before he opened fire at their vehicle, Superintendent Shaun Ferguson told reporters."Two of our officers were ambushed at the intersection of Royal and St. Philip Street," he said. Video from CNN affiliate WVUE showed crime scene tape around a police SUV with its front doors open.One officer, a four-year veteran, was hit by a bullet in the left cheek, just below his eye. He is in serious condition and is stable. The bullet is lodged in his skull, Ferguson said at a news conference near the scene. The other officer, a 16-year veteran, had minor abrasions. Both were taken to a hospital by fellow officers who came to the scene. The officer who was shot was responsive and able to walk into the hospital, Ferguson said."This is a dark day for our officers, so I ask that you keep our officers and their families in your prayers," he said.The suspect was taken into custody without incident and was sent to a hospital, the superintendent said. Ferguson added that the man, who would not identify himself, "appeared to be under some sort of medical condition."He was not injured by police, Ferguson said. A gun was found on the ground at the scene and the suspect was wearing a holster, the superintendent said.He added that a citizen helped treat the wounded officer."A retired Army veteran with medical experience was working in a nearby store and helped with the medical treatment of our officers until fellow officers arrived at the scene," he said."We also want to commend the citizens who pointed out the individual as officers were responding to this call," he added.The police department is conducting an investigation. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has not said whether it is involved in the investigation but a man wearing an ATF jacket was at the scene, video from CNN affiliate WDSU shows.(CNN) - Daily Covid-19 cases in the US reached a record high on Thursday, with experts warning that death rates could triple by mid-January.There were 88,521 new cases of the coronavirus reported in the US on Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University -- 9,540 more cases than Wednesday. In total, there have been more than 8,947,980 cases and at least 228,677 deaths in the US -- 971 of them on Thursday, JHU data shows."This is the hardest point in this pandemic right now -- the next two months," Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, said during an interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box" Thursday. "We can't give up our guard right now."Thursday's average marks an 82.68% increase in new cases over the last month, Johns Hopkins says. This week alone, the nation added a record-setting 536,131 cases. Total coronavirus cases could top 9 million Friday.   On Thursday, nine states reported their record high single-day of new cases ever:, Johns Hopkins reported: Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota and Ohio.   New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy told CNN Friday that he attributed the rise in cases to the cold, "fatigue" and indoor private gatherings.Murphy said he would consider a statewide curfew "if we had to," although he doesn't want it to come to that. In Newark, nonessential businesses must close at 8 p.m., among other restrictions.Murphy announced 2,089 cases Friday, marking the state's highest one-day total since May.Also Friday, Florida officials said the state had 5,592 more cases for a total of more than 800,000, according to the Florida Department of Health. Only California and Texas have surpassed 800,000, according to Johns Hopkins data.The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington School of Medicine says it is most likely that by the middle of January, 2,250 Americans will be dying every day from the coronavirus -- three times more than the current rate.And it could get much worse."If states do not react to rising numbers by re-imposing mandates, cumulative deaths could reach 514,000 by the same date," the IHME said in its latest forecast."The fall/winter surge should lead to a daily death toll that is approximately three times higher than now by mid-January. Hospital systems, particularly ICUs, are expected to be under extreme stress in December and January in 18 states."And hospitals are already under increased strain. As of Thursday, more than 46,000 people were hospitalized, according to the Covid Tracking Project, with all but 11 states seeing a rise in hospitalizations this week.States continue to break daily case count recordsForty-three states have shown an increase in cases compared to last week, with five holding steady and two -- Oklahoma and Louisiana -- reporting a decline, according to JHU.New Mexico reported 1,082 cases Thursday -- a record -- and a top health care executive there sounded the alarm about the direction of Covid-19 spread in his state."We are at an unsustainable growth rate," said Dr. Jason Mitchell Thursday. Mitchell is the chief medical officer at Presbyterian Healthcare Services, which operates nine regional hospitals in New Mexico.Mitchell says the state's rate of case growth is averaging about 5% a day, which would result in catastrophic numbers if there's no effort to change the trend. "By December, we would have so many cases that we would be in MASH tents," Mitchell said during a state health briefing.Illinois also reported a daily high of new cases for the second time in a week with 6,363 new cases Thursday. The total number of cases statewide now stands at 395,458, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health. Gov. J.B. Pritzker and IDPH announced that Region 3 would go into Covid-19 mitigation measures.Nine of the state's 11 regions will now be under resurgence mitigation measures due to the high average positivity rates. Minnesota, North Dakota and Ohio also reported their highest daily Covid-19 totals Thursday, with 2,872, 1,222 and 3,590 new positive cases respectively.Officials warn against traditional get-togethersThe Oregon Health Authority reported 575 new cases  Thursday, also breaking the state's single-day record. "Preliminary data show this increase reflects continued widespread community transmission resulting in small clusters and outbreaks statewide," the OHA said in a written statement. The state's coronavirus death toll is now 673.Health officials are strongly encouraging Oregonians to forgo traditional Halloween trick-or-treating and get-togethers this year.Murphy said New Jersey was seeing a fall surge, as he announced another 1,477 cases Thursday.Murphy urged residents not to take family members out of nursing homes for Thanksgiving."It's cold, it's rainy, our numbers are up. It gives me no joy to say you can't bring mom or dad out of the nursing home," Murphy said. "It gives me no joy to say you can't have your normal Thanksgiving."Higher rates of Covid-19 after Trump campaign ralliesA CNN investigation of 17 Trump campaign rallies finds that 14 of the host counties had an increased rate of new Covid-19 cases one month after the rally.The 17 rallies occurred between August 17 and September 26. CNN evaluated the rate of new daily cases per 100,000 residents at four weeks before the rally, on the rally date, and four weeks after the rally at the county level and at the state level.Of the 14 host counties that had increased infection rates, eight of them had declining rates of infection in the month before the rally. The other six counties already had increasing rates of infection in that preceding month.CNN's analysis also found that in 10 counties, the new rates of infection were growing faster than the overall rate for the state.The investigation evaluated rallies in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arizona, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, and Florida.(CNN) - Florida elections and law enforcement officials detected a scheme that sought to register dozens of dead people to vote in Broward County, though the motive is not clear, according to the county elections office.The county received about 50 voter registration applications sent in envelopes postmarked from Columbia, South Carolina, with no return address, documents show.The majority of the people named in the applications -- who were listed as Democrats -- were verified to be deceased and no votes were cast under their names, said Broward County elections spokesman Steven Vancore. Vancore said that Florida allows people to register to vote by mail but he said the county receives state data about people who have died and marks those individuals in its files as ineligible to vote. Florida requires a valid government ID to actually show up and vote, so Vancore said this scheme "only got half the equation" necessary to vote.  "Somebody went to great pains to exploit the system and it was caught," said Vancore. "We don't know if this person did this for pure chicanery or they were trying to alter the outcome of the election ... but there appears to be no attempt that this person voted." The South Florida Sun Sentinel was first to report the applications. Timothy Donnelly, an assistant state attorney, wrote in an August letter to Broward's supervisor of elections, Peter Antonacci, that he had launched an investigation into the applications and that there were "several potential criminal violations." Another employee of the state attorney's office wrote in an October 22 email to Antonacci that the applications appeared to be filled out by one person. "Due to the fact that they were mailed from out of state with no return address I'm unable to identify the person who submitted these applications," according to the correspondence shared with CNN. Only five of the names in the applications were actively registered in the county at that time, according to that email.Some of the applications were submitted under the names of people born more than a century ago -- one person's birth date was listed as 1917, according to the documents. A spokeswoman for the Broward's State Attorney's Office said Friday that the office could not comment on an active criminal investigation."We take any allegation of voter fraud very seriously because it affects our very democracy," said Broward County State Attorney Mike Satz. "Anyone who has information regarding any attempt to commit the crime of voter fraud should report it to the Broward Supervisor of Elections and the Broward State Attorney's Office so it can be thoroughly investigated."(CNN) - More than 600 adoptable cats and dogs were airlifted from Hawaii to the US mainland in the largest animal rescue flight in history, according to Hawaii's Emergency Management Agency.Dubbed "Paws Across the Pacific," a chartered Hercules C-130 plane flew across the Hawaiian Islands on October 28, picking up dogs and cats from overcrowded shelters on Kauai, Oahu and Maui."Pet shelters in Hawaii are in a COVID-19 crisis. Normal operations have been affected by months of shut down, economic downturn, limited hours, and routine flights to mainland halted," said Liz Baker, CEO of Greater Good Charities, which supported the flight. "The Paws Across the Pacific flight is urgently needed to make space in Hawaii's shelters for at-risk pets who otherwise wouldn't be able to receive necessary care to survive."The plane landed at Seattle's Boeing Field on Thursday, where it was met by volunteers from pet shelter and rescue groups across Washington State, Oregon, Idaho and Montana. Baker had a personal interest in its success -- a chocolate puppy lab that she has named "Hilo" in honor of his hometown. She decided to adopt the dog after the sudden death of her dog, Stella.She made the trek from Phoenix to Seattle to meet the plane on the tarmac at Boeing Field. "I know there are other Stellas on that flight," she told CNN with tears in her eyes, holding Hilo in her arms. "We are so proud to help all of these animals find loving homes."Taking hundreds of dogs and cats out of Hawaii was no easy feat. The airlift was done in coordination with the Hawaii Veterinary Medical Association to ensure they all arrived safely.Greater Good Charities, the John R. Peterson Foundation, the Animal Rescue Site, Banfield Foundation, VCA Pet Charities, Tito's Handmade Vodka, the Petco Foundation, Royal Canin and Healthy Paws Pet Insurance & Foundation all supported the journey.Baker confirmed to CNN that all the animals on board "Paws Across the Pacific" arrived in Seattle healthy, as she prepared to take Hilo back to her home to Phoenix. For more information on how to adopt these animals, contact PAWS, The NOAH Center, Seattle Humane, the Humane Society of Skagit Valley, Kitsap Humane, Oregon Humane, Southwest Washington Humane, Kootenai Humane Society, Seattle Area Feline Rescue (SAFR), Tracs, Spokanimal, Blue Mountain Humane Society and the Embrace a Discarded Pet Society.(CNN) - Melania Trump tweeted a video of herself posted Thursday discussing for three minutes the efforts the Trump administration has made to support the rights of the gay community, blaming sentiments that President Donald Trump opposes gay rights on his "many enemies in the political establishment." "I was shocked to discover that some of these powerful people have tried to paint my husband as anti-gay or against equality. Nothing could be further from the truth," said the first lady. However, Trump has as President made several policy decisions which have affected the rights and lives of the gay community, and not in a positive way. As a presidential candidate, Trump ran on his personal belief supporting marriage only between a man and a woman.In 2015, Trump told CNN's Jake Tapper: "I'm just for traditional marriage."And in 2011, before running for office, Trump was asked by Fox News' Bill O'Reilly about same-sex marriage."I just don't feel good about it. I don't feel right about it. I'm against it and I take a lot of heat because I come from New York. You know, for New York it's like, how can you be against gay marriage? But I'm opposed to gay marriage," he said.But Melania Trump in the video touts her husband as the "first president to enter the White House supporting gay marriage." A week after the election, Trump said in a televised interview that he was "fine with" the Supreme Court decision to allow same-sex marriage, but it was not exactly a ringing endorsement. "It's irrelevant because it's already settled," he said of whether he supports same-sex marriage. Within six months of his tenure, Trump proposed a ban on transgender individuals entering the military. Though a discrimination case reached the Supreme Court in January 2019, the court didn't rule on the legality of the ban, meaning it could go into effect and dealing a blow to LGBTQ activists.Trump also reminds viewers that her husband is the leader of the Republican Party, in addition to being President, adding in her estimation he has always treated gays and lesbians equally. Yet the official Republican Party platform opposes same-sex marriage and calls for overturning Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court decision that legalized it.In the video, which was posted to the Twitter account of the Log Cabin Republicans, a group of pro-gay rights Republicans who advocate for equal rights, and retweeted on Trump's social media accounts, the first lady says America under her husband, "protects diversity." In truth, the administration is rolling back parts of the Affordable Care Act that directly affect transgender and non-binary Americans. Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, passed under former President Barack Obama in 2010, prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded health programs and activities; a 2016 rule interpreted this as including discrimination on the basis of gender identity. The Trump administration has limited the scope of that section of the law to stop offering civil rights protection to transgender and non-binary people.The Log Cabin Republicans voted against endorsing Trump in 2016 but have endorsed him this time around.Melania Trump also noted American citizens "condemn those who bully and intimidate people," though her husband has spent much of his presidency doing just that, especially on Twitter. And in recent months, the President has mocked and name-called members of the media as well as Democratic candidate Joe Biden for practicing social distancing and wearing masks, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to claim lives.Washington  (CNN) - Shortly after joining the White House as President Donald Trump's pandemic adviser, Dr. Scott Atlas launched a quiet effort that seemed counterintuitive to some of his colleagues -- encouraging officials to limit Covid-19 testing mainly to people experiencing symptoms.Their push to de-emphasize tests coincided with a dramatic drop in testing across Florida, even as the country was careening toward a fall coronavirus surge. A CNN analysis of the Florida state official numbers, aggregated by the Covid Tracking Project, shows that testing dropped off at the end of July and early August, with a peak seven-day average over 90,000 tests per day on July 18. Six weeks later, in early September, the seven-day average dropped by nearly half, with fewer than 48,000 tests per day, and hovered between there and 60,000 during the fall.  Though both Atlas and DeSantis declined to discuss their views with CNN for this story, they have articulated them in public. Some state and local officials believe the pair was influential in taking Trump's anti-testing pronouncements and helping to turn them into public policy. And the drop-off in testing is of deep concern to some. It took place as positivity rates remained high, in the range that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers indicative of high community spread. Atlas: From Fox commentator to trusted Trump adviserAfter advising the White House for several weeks, Atlas officially joined the Trump administration on August 10 at the request of the President. Trump had seen Atlas in interviews on Fox News, where he expressed skepticism about the scientific consensus on Covid-19.Among other things, Atlas had asserted that it doesn't matter "how many cases" there are in the US. His thoughts jibed with Trump's, and, upon announcing his hire, the President promised Atlas would "take it to a new level," suggesting Atlas would help the administration tackle the pandemic. One of Atlas' earliest moves as a member of the task force was to work to revise CDC guidelines in order to de-emphasize the need for asymptomatic testing, according to two sources familiar with the process.    DeSantis shares some Trump ideas about the pandemic Following Trump's demands in July that schools across the country reopen, the governor became a vocal proponent of returning Florida schools to normal operations. DeSantis supported an emergency order issued by his education commissioner in July that public schools should prepare to open five days a week for in-person learning, comparing schools to open retailers like Walmart and Home Depot.He also criticized some universities in the state for what he called "draconian" punishments for students who violated Covid-19 protocols.An aide to DeSantis said the governor is simply focused on protecting the vulnerable and reopening the economy.   Immunizing the herd The idea that asymptomatic people should not be tested is highly controversial among infectious disease experts.   Zlín, Czech Republic  (CNN) - "We help with hygiene, sometimes we draw blood, we do..." mid-sentence, Barbara Sásová looks over for help finding the right English word to describe her duties. "Sanitary work," she says, nervously giggling. At just 18 years old, she's a nurses' assistant at a hospital in Kyjov, a small town in eastern Czech Republic less than half an hour from the Slovakian border. The teenager attends a healthcare-focused high school nearby, but with schools shut down across the country to stem the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, she's been catapulted into the adult world, inside a hospital where she is badly needed. Some of her colleagues are only 16, unable to vote, or even drive. "I think it is our duty because we are the future of health workers," Sásová said."The situation is very serious. The Czech health system never faced such a challenge before. Every day there is an increase of 1,000 sick health care workers. With 10 million people in the Czech Republic, this is a serious number," said Dr. Milan Kubek, president of the Czech Medical Chamber.As of October 28, according to Kubek, 15,433 health care workers have been sidelined with the virus; almost 3,000 of them are doctors. Most are catching the virus not at work, but on the streets, or from friends or relatives, Kubek believes. The numbers are so high that Czech hospitals are limping along with vital help from volunteers -- who get bonus points for having medical experience -- but beggars can't be choosers. "The health care system in the Czech Republic already collapsed because hospitals, with a few exceptions, are not able to provide long-term care for non-Covid patients," said Jiri Vyhnal, the head ER doctor in Kyjov. About 35 miles east, in the city of Zlín, 21-year-old Marie Hanackova, in her final year of nursing college, now logs 12-hour shifts caring for less-severe coronavirus patients."There is an insane panic here. People are simply afraid. During my practical training last year, they were calmer," she told CNN, dressed in full hazmat gear. The panic is understandable. The Czech Republic has an infection rate that is higher than almost any other major country on earth -- six times higher than the United States. Officially, one in every 63 people in the country are currently infected with the virus. Seven hospital departments in Zlín have been shut down to make way for the onslaught of Covid-19 patients. CNN was allowed inside the intensive care unit (ICU) where all of the beds equipped to handle coronavirus patients on ventilators are occupied. Some patients are cared for in what used to be a storage room across the hall. But space isn't the primary issue, staffing is.            "We don't have enough nurses, doctors and technicians," explained Dr. Tomá Gabrhelík, the head ICU doctor in Zlín. About 15% of his colleagues are out sick with the virus. He says he will soon have to ask them to come back to work even if they're still ill. Students and volunteers are helpful, he says, but doctors are irreplaceable. The government, he says, can only do so much to help, "because every region has the same problem."The hospital says if things don't change, it will be forced to turn away new patients by November 2.On top of the health crisis, the Czech Republic also has a political one. Last week, Health Minister Roman Prymula was accused of breaking his own coronavirus restrictions. The centrist, populist Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis immediately called for his resignation. After first resisting, Prymula agreed to step down after a replacement is chosen -- the third Czech health minister in just the last six weeks, at the height of one of the worst outbreaks the planet has ever seen.The sudden turn-for-the-worst comes after the Czech government was praised for its handling of the first wave in the spring. A strict stay-at-home order, along with an unpopular but effective legal mandate to wear a mask anywhere outside the home helped quickly tamp down the virus. By early summer, the daily death toll was down to zero. After that, it seems complacency set in.Now, the Czech military just finished setting up a 500-bed field hospital -- staffed entirely with military doctors and nurses, who will have to be pulled out of civilian hospitals to help."We don't have enough medical staff, therefore we welcome very much the help from abroad," said Dr. Kubek. In the spring, northern Italy found itself in a similar position -- hospitals swelling with patients, with too few beds and even fewer doctors and nurses. The Italian government appealed to its neighbors for assistance. Medics from around the world answered the call. But the Czech government declined to send its military doctors abroad."The military doctors were needed here as well," Deputy Defense Minister Jan Havránek explained to CNN, though he also conceded that the first wave of Covid-19 in the spring was "rather mild." The Czechs did send truckloads of PPE to Italy and Spain, but no personnel. Now, the Czech government is in the awkward position of asking its neighbors to send the same type of health workers it declined to send them a few months ago. Asked if the Czechs will think harder about sending personnel next time their neighbors need help, Havránek said the lesson has been learned. "Definitely we will... we realize that it's a two-way street, and we cannot just ask without giving back."The US National Guard has committed to sending a few dozen medics to the Czech Republic, and the European Union will send 300.They're nice gestures, but only a drop in the bucket. It will take 140 more doctors and nurses to make just the Zlín Hospital alone fully functional again.It's unlikely the Czechs will get much more help than that. With coronavirus cases surging across Europe, countries are starting to prepare for their own worst-case-scenarios. The Czech Republic may soon have to fight this battle on its own.(CNN) - Kyle Rittenhouse, an Illinois teenager accused of fatally shooting two men and wounding a third during protests, was extradited to Wisconsin after a judge's ruling on Friday.Judge Paul Novak of Lake County, Illinois, said in the ruling allowing his extradition that matters filed by Rittenhouse's attorneys such as the safety of their client can be brought up in hearings in Wisconsin.Rittenhouse is now detained in Kenosha County Jail, said Sgt. David Wright of the Kenosha County Sheriff's Department.  Rittenhouse, 17, is facing charges that he allegedly killed Anthony M. Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz during a protest over the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on August 25.He faces one counts of first degree intentional homicide, one count of first degree reckless homicide, one count of attempt at first degree intentional homicide, two counts of first degree recklessly endangering safety, and one count of possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18.If convicted on the intentional homicide charge, he could be sentenced to life in prison.Rittenhouse's attorneys did not respond to CNN's request for comment on Friday afternoon.One of his attorneys, John Pierce, tweeted they would appeal the ruling."While we have great respect for Judge Novak, we obviously and strongly disagree with today's decision. Kyle has an absolute statutory right to appeal the denial of his habeas corpus petition pursuant to 725 ILCS 225/10," Pierce wrote. "We will never surrender. Kyle will be set free and cleared of all charges."Rittenhouse's attorneys have maintained that Rittenhouse was acting in self-defense when he opened fire. Rittenhouse was arrested in his home state of Illinois, and has been held without bond in a juvenile detention center in Vernon Hills since late August. Earlier this month, Rittenhouse's attorneys filed a petition for habeas corpus, arguing that "to extradite Rittenhouse would be to turn him over to the mob." A writ of habeas corpus is used to bring a prisoner or detainee before the court to determine whether the person's imprisonment or detention is lawful.People have threatened the teen's life and "encouraged fellow inmates to kill Rittenhouse and have offered bounties," Pierce and attorney Michael Baker wrote in the petition. During the hearing, Pierce called the case "a very unique, extraordinary situation" and said that there is a "massive amount of video evidence that shows that there's beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this is not a legitimate criminal prosecution."  Mike Nerheim, the Lake County state's attorney, told reporters at the time that his office's position is that Rittenhouse should be tried in Kenosha and that he doesn't think there would be any elevated danger if he's extradited. "I don't know that he's in any more or less danger here than he would be there," Nerheim said, adding that there have been threats made while Rittenhouse has been in custody. (CNN) - The Philadelphia police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr. has raised questions about why the 27-year-old was shot and killed, rather than tased and detained.Wallace, who had a knife in his hand, was described by family members as having bipolar disorder and was in crisis during the time of the shooting. "All I'm thinking in my head is, 'Where the Tasers at?'" JaHiem Simpson, who took video of the police shooting, told CNN. He said he saw officers pull their guns as soon as they saw the knife. Police said the officers were not equipped with Tasers. Philadelphia Council President Darrell L. Clarke said Wednesday there is a five-year plan by the police calling for $14 million in expenditures for new Tasers. But some experts say that the officers choosing to use their guns was the correct amount of force on Wallace, because of the fact that he had a weapon. Darrin Porcher, Pace University criminal justice professor and retired New York Police Department lieutenant, said the officers could be seen backpedaling in the video because they were trying to maintain what's known as the "zone of safety," which is typically 10 feet."Once Mr. Wallace impeded on that 10 feet, that's when they used deadly force, that's when they shot him," Porcher said. "Based on a knife entering the equation, I think that made the firearm the more probable weapon to be deployed in this situation." Charles Ramsey, former Philadelphia police commissioner, said while the outcome was not anything anyone wanted, he "didn't see anything criminal on the side of the officers."Wallace's family is not calling for the officers involved in his death to face murder charges, family attorney Shaka Johnson said. Instead, they want to see every officer equipped with less-than-lethal equipment to ensure better responses to mental health incidents."They want to see change, meaning that, no one else who is suffering from a mental health crisis should be met by ill-trained, ill-prepared, ill-equipped police officers," Johnson said.Taser considered intermediate use of forceThe Philadelphia manual of directives says "aggressive action will not be taken by police personnel" when dealing with a severely mentally disabled person, "unless there is an immediate threat to life or physical danger" to that person, the police or others present. The use of a Taser, or electronic control weapon (ECW) is seen as an intermediate use of force. Verbal commands are considered no force and using a firearm is considered deadly force.According to Porcher, the only other non-lethal devices that could have been used during the confrontation would've been a baton or pepper spray."It would've been a challenge using a baton" because if you swing and miss, an officer could've been cut, he said. And with pepper spray, "if you get the blow back while in the street, you become the victim in what you deployed." "They wouldn't have been prudent situations," he said. As far as shooting Wallace in the arm or leg, Porcher said aiming at limbs is a much smaller target and officers are trained to shoot center mass. "It's the largest target on the body," he said. "Police are trained to shoot to stop, not shoot to kill." Ramsey said when someone is armed, officers go with what they believe can counteract that weapon. "Everything is dependent on what's going on at the moment and the nature of the threat," he said. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said Monday the department has the technology to flag a call that has a behavioral health component, but the person in that role was not working at the time of Wallace's shooting. Outlaw did emphasize that the department itself does not have a behavioral health program at this time. "Through other city entities, (there are) behavioral health resources," she said. "We are evaluating how we can bring our programs together." Philadelphia Police's plan for TasersAbout 4,500 patrol officers make up Philadelphia's police force and the department has 2,300 Tasers, Outlaw said in a news conference Wednesday."What the conversation is today is how do we ensure that we get enough Tasers so that every officer -- at least every officer that's working in operations -- has a Taser," Outlaw said.Ramsey was police commissioner from 2008 to 2016, during which time the department was assessed by the US Department of Justice and he requested more funding for Tasers. A 2015 report from the Justice Department found "serious deficiencies" in the Philadelphia Police Department's use of force, finding about 15% of police shootings were of unarmed suspects who were mistaken for being armed.The assessment also found that Philadelphia police officers do not receive the sufficient training required to de-escalate potentially violent confrontations. For some recruits, this training has been nothing more than lectures.The Justice Department recommended regular and consistent training of the department's deadly force policy and that ECWs be starndard issue weapons for every officers. "We provide crisis intervention training to our officers to ensure there's not only a focus on de-escalation, but slowing things down if situations allow for that," Outlaw said.Not every officer in the city is equipped with Tasers, Outlaw said Tuesday. Officers who would be equipped with Tasers include lieutenants, sergeants and uniformed patrol officers, Porcher said. It's common for officers to respond to domestic disturbances with a gun because it's "one of the tools that we carry on our tool belt," she said.The department gets $900,000 a year for the electrical weapons, enough to buy a few hundred per year, Outlaw said.Philadelphia's City Council has funded the first year of the five-year plan to get more Tasers, which was $4.5 million, said Clarke, the Philadelphia Council President. "Year to year you have to get funding for that," Ramsey said, adding that 95% of the budget goes to personnel costs. "Police department budgets don't have money for equipment." (CNN) - Forty-five years to the day after 15-year-old Martha Moxley went missing, prosecutors for the state of Connecticut said Friday that they would not retry Michael Skakel in her brutal slaying.Skakel, 60 and the nephew of Robert and Ethel Kennedy, served roughly half of a 20-year sentence for Moxley's death.Addressing the Stamford Superior Court on Friday, State's Attorney Richard Colangelo said the state would no longer pursue charges against Skakel."Looking at the evidence, your honor, looking at the state of the case, it is my belief that the state cannot prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt," he said.Colangelo said that he had "basically reinvestigated the case" and found no additional evidence to present. He also said that of 51 potential witnesses, 17 of them are now deceased.Following Colangelo's announcement, neither Skakel nor his attorney addressed the court.Speaking with CNN after the hearing, Skakel's attorney, Stephan Seeger, maintained that his client was innocent."It's a relief that the state has concluded they could not prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt -- they never could," Seeger said. "He should never have been convicted in the first place.""He's spent his whole life pursuing a result like today," Seeger said. "It's the first day of the rest of his life."Moxley's brother, John, addressed the court to thank law enforcement and express his agreement with the decision not to pursue a retrial.Outside of court, he told reporters that he still believed Skakel was responsible for his sister's death.Moxley went missing on October 30, 1975, after a night of partying with Skakel, his older brother Tommy Skakel and other teenagers in an affluent gated community in Greenwich, Connecticut. The next day Moxley was found bludgeoned and stabbed to death, and a broken golf club was found near her body.Skakel was convicted in 2002 but was released from prison in 2013 when courts ordered a new trial. Skakel's murder conviction was vacated in 2018 by the Connecticut Supreme Court, which ruled that his attorney had deprived him of a fair trial by failing to call an alibi witness. Since then, it's been unclear if a new trial would be held.(CNN) - Joe Biden's lead in national and state polls has Democrats well-positioned to have a good night up and down the ballot next week. The latest race ratings from Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales, a CNN contributor, tell the story: Democrats aren't just playing in red states and districts; they're seriously competitive in many of them, with more than a third of registered voters having already cast their ballots and less than a week to go until Election Day. Inside Elections now projects Democrats to pick up a net gain of 14 to 20 seats in the House, building on their historic 2018 midterm gains to grow their House majority, and a net gain of four to six seats in the Senate, which would be enough to flip the chamber. (Democrats need a net gain of three seats if Biden wins the White House, since the vice president breaks ties in the Senate, or four if he loses.) But the nonpartisan election analyst notes that greater Democratic gains in the Senate are possible. Inside Elections has shifted three Senate races in Democrats' favor: Alaska and the two Georgia races. Both are red states that Trump carried in 2016. But in Georgia particularly, Trump is struggling to match his margin from four years ago, with some public polls showing him trailing Biden, who visited the Peach State this week. There are few states that capture just how quickly demographics are changing American politics than Georgia, which hasn't voted for a Democrat for president since 1992. Three years ago, a special election for a House seat in the well-educated and affluent Atlanta suburbs was viewed as a referendum on the President several months into his administration. Democrats came up short. But just over a year later, in the 2018 midterms, Democrats flipped the 6th District, which the party is now even more likely to hold this year, according to Inside Elections' latest ratings. The neighboring 7th District, which Democrats came about 400 votes shy of flipping in 2018, tops CNN's ranking of the seats most likely to flip in 2020. Interactive: 2020 House race ratingsOverall, 23 House races shifted toward Democrats this week, with just one race in Texas shifting in Republicans' favor. Many of these shifts toward Democrats are in longtime red districts, underscoring both how favorable the national environment is for Democrats and, in many cases, just how much partisanship in this country is being redrawn around suburban and rural lines. Senate race ratings changesThe biggest changes are in Georgia. Jon Ossoff was the Democrat who came up short in that 2017 special election for the House, falling just shy of the 50% threshold in the first round and then losing the runoff. Now Ossoff is challenging GOP Sen. David Perdue, and he has at least a shot at crossing 50%, especially if Biden is doing very well in the state. It's not a clear path  there's a third-party candidate that could make it tough for either major party candidate to surpass 50. January runoffs in red states have usually benefited Republicans, but it's hard to tell what that dynamic will look like without knowing the outcome of the presidential race or the balance of power in the Senate. Inside Elections moves the race from Tilt Republican to Toss-up, signifying the incumbent no longer has a clear advantage here.The other Georgia race -- the special election to fill the former Sen. Johnny Isakson's seat  also shifts in Democrats' favor, but Republicans still have a slight edge here. Appointed Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running to keep the seat, but she's facing Democrats and Republicans all on the same November ballot, almost guaranteeing a January runoff since no one will be able to surpass 50% on Election Day. While Democrats have consolidated behind Rev. Raphael Warnock, Loeffler is still dueling with GOP Rep. Doug Collins for a spot in the runoff. Both Republican candidates are trying to run close to the President to try to lock up GOP base support, with Loeffler going so far on Wednesday as to say she wasn't familiar with the "Access Hollywood" tape on which Trump boasts about sexually assaulting women. Inside Elections moved the race from Lean Republican to Tilt Republican. Alaska, where GOP Sen. Dan Sullivan is running for a second term, also became less safe for Republicans -- moving from Likely to Lean Republican. Trump carried the state by 15 points in 2016, but Sullivan is up against Independent Al Gross, who's running with the backing of national Democrats and raised $3 million in the first two weeks of October compared to Sullivan's $458,000. Gross is just one example of a Senate challenger who's put a red state in play by vastly outraising the GOP incumbent. Suburban districts moving toward DemocratsMany of the House districts moving toward Democrats are in suburban areas. That was true in 2018, too, with well-educated voters in sprawling metropolitan areas rejecting the President. The question in many traditionally red districts this year, with Trump on the ballot, was whether voters would take their anger out on Trump, and only Trump, continuing to vote Republican down the rest of the ticket. But given how closely most down-ballot Republicans have stood with Trump over the past four years and how nationalized House races have become, more of them are now at risk of going down with the President. Arkansas' 2nd District, for example, voted for Trump by more than 10 points in 2016, while reelecting GOP Rep. French Hill by nearly 22 points. Two years later, Hill won by only 6 points. And now because of shifts in the greater Little Rock suburbs, the district moves from a Tilt Republican to Toss-up race, with Hill facing a strong challenge from Democratic state Sen. Joyce Elliott.It's a similar story in several other GOP-held districts that Trump won that are moving even closer to Democrats in the ratings: That includes places like Indiana's 5th District (an open seat), Missouri's 2nd District (help by GOP Rep. Ann Wagner), Nebraska's 2nd District (held by GOP Rep. Don Bacon), Ohio's 1st District (held by GOP Rep. Steve Chabot) and Texas' 24th District (an open seat). Those are all now Tilt Democratic races.Several suburban seats that Democrats flipped in 2018 are also becoming safer for the majority party. Georgia's 6th District, which Ossoff lost in that expensive special election, moves from Lean Democratic to Likely Democratic. New Jersey's 7th District, where Democratic freshman Rep. Tom Malinowski is facing Republican Tom Kean in the affluent exurbs of New York City, moves from Lean Democratic to Likely Democratic. Democrats also flipped New Jersey's 2nd District in 2018, but Rep. Jeff Van Drew's party-switch around the impeachment vote handed it back to Republicans. Now the South Jersey district, which voted for Trump, may return to Democratic hands. The loyalty Van Drew pledged to Trump, which he had hoped would save his seat, could now be costing him. His race against Democrat Amy Kennedy moved from Toss-up to Tilt Democratic. Virginia's 2nd District, another 2018 flip, also looks safer for Democrats. Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria is in a rematch against Scott Taylor, the former Republican congressman whom she defeated. Trump isn't likely to repeat his 2016 victory in this Virginia Beach district, either, making it a Likely Democratic contest. Another rematch, this one in Washington State, moves toward Democrats as GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler again tries to fend off Democrat Carolyn Long. Inside Elections shifts the race from Likely Republican to Lean Republican. Democrats increasingly competitive, including in rural areasIt's not just the affluent suburbs of New York City, St. Louis or Indianapolis, where Democrats are becoming more competitive. Two rural seats in Iowa, where Biden is keeping things close, move from Tilt Democratic to Lean Democratic. Democratic Rep. Abby Finkenauer is trying to hold onto the 1st District, which she flipped in 2018, and is facing one of the GOP's favorite recruits in Ashley Hinson. Democrat Rita Hart is trying to keep the 2nd District in Democratic hands since longtime Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack is retiring. She's facing perennial GOP candidate Mariannette Miller-Meeks. Minnesota was ground zero for partisan shifts along geographic lines in the 2018 midterms: Democrats picked up two seats around the Twin Cities while losing a mining region in the north and an agriculture-heavy district in the south. But now that rural southern district, one of just three seats nationwide that Republicans flipped in 2018, is moving from Toss-up to Tilt Democratic. GOP Rep. Jim Hagedorn has faced fundraising, ethics and health issues in his rematch against Iraq war veteran Dan Feehan.And then there's Virginia's 5th District, which moves from Tilt Republican to Toss-up, a remarkable shift in a rural district that voted for Trump by 11 points. Republican Bob Good defeated incumbent GOP Rep. Denver Riggleman at a party convention this summer, but he hasn't been able to put together a strong operation, which is giving Democrat Cameron Webb an opportunity to seriously contest the Charlottesville-area district. North Carolina, home to a tight presidential and Senate race, is also seeing some surprising, late shifts at the House level. It would've been difficult to imagine at the beginning of the cycle that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows' old North Carolina seat would be competitive for anyone other than a Republican. Even after court-mandated redistricting, which made the district slightly less Republican by including most of the liberal enclave of Asheville, it remained a mostly rural and conservative district. But Republican Madison Cawthorn, who upset the Meadows- and Trump-backed candidate in the primary, has faced a series of negative headlines that is making this race more competitive for Col. Moe Davis, a Democrat who might also benefit from some of Biden's momentum in the state. It moves from Likely to Lean Republican.Farther to the east, in North Carolina's 8th District near Fayetteville, GOP Rep. Richard Hudson is in a real race against former state Supreme Court Justice Pat Timmons-Goodson. How real is it? Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC tied to GOP leadership, is now spending at least $3.6 million to make sure they don't lose it. It moves from Lean to Tilt Republican.Colorado's 3rd District might not be notable if Lauren Boebert hadn't upset incumbent Rep. Scott Tipton in the GOP primary earlier this year. But the restaurateur and gun rights advocate, who has expressed some familiarity with and sympathy for QAnon before trying to distance herself from the conspiracy theory, is making the contest competitive against Democrat Diane Mitsch Bush, who lost by about 8 points in 2018. The race is now Tilt Republican. Ground zero?The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has called Texas its ground zero in its effort to expand the majority. Inside Elections rates nine of the state's 36 congressional districts as competitive. And now three GOP-held seats have become more competitive for Democrats. One seat, however, moves away from them back into the Solid Republican column. The bright spots for Democrats are in the 24th District, mentioned above, where the national environment favors Candace Valenzuela to win an open seat in the suburbs north of Dallas and Fort Worth. She would be the first Afro-Latina in Congress.Elsewhere, GOP Rep. Van Taylor is running for a second term in the 3rd District, which voted for Trump but is a highly educated area. Biden's competitiveness in the state, especially the suburbs, may give Democrats a better shot. It moves from Likely to Lean Republican.The 10th District, where GOP Rep. Michael McCaul is running for an eighth term, also shifts from Likely to Lean Republican. But Trump carried this district by about 9 points in 2016, and the former Homeland Security Committee Chairman still has the advantage here. Texas' 2nd District moves in the opposite direction, with GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw -- of Saturday Night Live fame  looking like he'll be coming back to Congress. His seat is now Solid Republican. No longer competitive for RepublicansSeveral seats have dropped off the map off competitive seats, meaning they're now considered safe for Democrats.That's the case in New Jersey's 3rd District -- including parts of the Jersey shore and Philadelphia suburbs -- which Trump carried in 2016. Rep. Andy Kim flipped the district in 2018, and the Democratic freshman is far outspending his GOP opponent. Republicans had been eager to take out Democratic Rep. Ron Kind in Wisconsin's 3rd District, another place that voted for Trump in 2016. And this race briefly moved out of the Solid Democratic category earlier this year. But Kind and Biden look like they'll do well here. Pennsylvania's 17th District also moves to a Solid Democratic race, with Rep. Conor Lamb, who first came to Congress in a 2018 special election, in a good place to keep his seat, which includes Pittsburgh suburbs.Editor's Note: Scott Jennings, a CNN contributor and Republican campaign adviser, is a former special assistant to President George W.

View more opinion articles on CNN.(CNN) - The case for President Donald Trump is simple: He made the economy work for so many Americans, kept us out of new and costly wars and even brokered peace deals in the Middle East. He believes our taxes should be lower, not higher -- and signed into law sweeping tax relief for businesses and the vast majority of federal income tax filers. He thinks government shouldn't overregulate, rolling back numerous Obama-era overreaches, while working with his Republican allies in Congress. And despite his relative dovishness, he has invested in our military and in the men and women who wear the uniform. As a result, our enemies know we are more than capable of finishing them. Just ask the former leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi or former Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. Beyond that, Trump stands up against the worst impulses of the American left and the radicals who seek to banish from the public square those who dare to think differently. Heck, even the Girl Scouts deleted a tweet congratulating Amy Coney Barrett on her elevation to the Supreme Court because of pressure from the liberal Twitter mob. Is that the kind of American we want, where unhinged progressives can shut down even a simple tweet of congrats to an accomplished female judge? Whatever problems I have with him -- and there are more than a few -- Trump's willingness to stand up to this kind of mob impresses the hell out of me. Standing by Justice Brett Kavanaugh during a tough confirmation fight, for instance, was a particularly proud moment. Trump is not a perfect person. His personal history, and the way he speaks to and about people can be atrocious. But Trump did become the first sitting president to attend the March for Life Rally this year, where he voiced his unwavering support for "unborn children," who he said "never had a stronger defender in the White House." Whether his views on abortion are pure or transactional, I care not. He stands up for the unborn who can't stand up for themselves -- and has appointed judges, like Barrett, who will hopefully do the same. Elections are choices. Pro-life or pro-choice. Higher taxes or lower taxes. Support free speech or coddle censorship. No politician ever satisfies me fully, but Trump comes far closer than Joe Biden ever could. There's room for Trump to improve, but in no way does Biden represent a step in a policy direction that I can support as a conservative. He fails the test on virtually every issue I care about, and I expect the United States would move radically left on his watch, especially on abortion.  And for all of the President's missteps, including his rhetorical failures in dealing with coronavirus, this vote is about the next four years. We will likely have a vaccine soon (and in large part thanks to Trump's leadership on Operation Warp Speed), and we will defeat this virus no matter who wins. So, who can lead us through that day and beyond, restoring the American economy and stopping the radicals from tearing up the American political institutions they find inconvenient? Donald J. Trump.Editor's Note: Stuart E.

View more opinion at CNN. (CNN) - The 2020 election is especially important for American Jewish voters. Anti-Semitism is growing here in America and around the world. Meanwhile, Israel's security is under serious threat from Iran and its terrorist proxies. And aging Jews, many of whom survived the horrors of the Holocaust, are now facing another threat to their lives due to the Covid-19 pandemic. To meet these challenges, I am urging American Jews to vote for Joe Biden for president.I have devoted my life to fighting anti-Semitism, defending Israel's security and seeking restitution for Holocaust survivors. I can proudly affirm that Biden has been a highly outspoken and effective leader for these causes throughout his public career as a US senator and vice president. But beyond that, Biden is a deeply decent man with a strong moral core. President Donald Trump sees the country as red states versus blue states. Biden, on the other hand, sees the country for what it is -- the United States of America. As president, Biden will bring us together, give no quarter to hatemongers, and begin the work of healing our nation's wounds from Trump's divisive rhetoric and his tendency to throw kerosene on smoldering embers.Anti-Semitic assaults in America have increased dramatically in the past two years. We should remember that Biden decided to run for president because of his horror at the neo-Nazis who marched in Charlottesville. Trump, on the other hand, called them "very fine people." That's not the only time Trump has stoked hatred -- he recently told the Proud Boys to "stand back and stand by," and he condemned Michigan's governor even after armed men plotted to kidnap her.  Israel will always have a time-tested friend in the Oval Office with Biden, who has shown his deep personal commitment to Israel as a Jewish state with Jerusalem as its eternal capital. His support for Israel was imparted to him by his father and it has lasted a lifetime. In 1973, he visited Israel for the first time and later called his encounter with Prime Minister Golda Meir "one of the most consequential meetings I've ever had in my life." It was the first of many trips to Israel (Trump, on the other hand, has been only once). Meir impressed upon him the sense of vulnerability under which Israelis live and it seems that lesson remains seared in his consciousness to this day. In remarks he delivered during the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's Policy Conference earlier this year, Biden said, "Israelis wake up every morning facing an existential threat from their neighbors -- a rain of rockets from Gaza ... threats and missiles from Iran and Hezbollah." For him, these are not mere words. Biden was an early advocate for US aid to deploy Israel's lifesaving Iron Dome anti-missile system. As vice president, he was a central architect of the $38 billion military aid package to Israel --the largest in history.He has been a lifelong defender of Israel's qualitative military edge and will safeguard it as president. Biden has also fervently opposed the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, and the Democratic Party's 2020 platform explicitly opposes "any effort to unfairly single out and delegitimize Israel, including at the United Nations, or through the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement."  Biden's record of concrete support for Israel is longer, deeper, more heartfelt and less politically motivated than Trump's. When I successfully negotiated billions of dollars in European compensation and restitution payments to Holocaust survivors on behalf of the American government, I had no greater supporter than Joe Biden, first in his capacity as the top Democrat responsible for European issues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and later as our nation's vice president.  In 2013, Biden launched an unprecedented domestic initiative for the US government to specifically aid aging Holocaust survivors, more than a third of whom are living in or near poverty after suffering so grievously during their youth. His work ultimately led to $12 million in new federal funding for Holocaust survivors in the US to be disbursed over five years.Furthermore, Biden insists that "we must educate every successive generation to exactly what happened, so that we can never forget the horrors of the Shoah." Only 15 states require Holocaust education as part of their secondary school curricula, but I am confident Biden will work toward having all 50 states teach the Holocaust and its lessons.By electing Biden, we will put a mensch in the White House who is committed to the best of Jewish and American values to help the needy. I know from personal experience that Biden is someone who does the right thing, not just for show or for personal advantage. I remain eternally grateful that he made time in 2013 to join and address the shiva of my beloved, late wife, Fran, despite his busy schedule as vice president. He did so unannounced and without any press coverage.Drawing on his deep and abiding decency, humanity and empathy, Biden will work every day to heal and unite our divided country, and to appeal to the best of America. Joe Biden deserves the support of Jewish Americans, and I urge you to cast your vote for him.(CNN) - Philippine officials on Saturday ordered the evacuation of thousands of residents in the southern part of the main Luzon island, as the world's strongest storm this year approached the Southeast Asian nation.Typhoon Goni -- known locally as Rolly -- is a category 5 storm with 215 kilometers per hour (133 miles per hour) sustained winds and gusts of up to 265 kph (164 mph). It will make landfall on Sunday as the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines since Haiyan killed more than 6,300 people in November 2013.Pre-emptive evacuations have started in coastal and landslide-prone communities in the provinces of Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur, while the Albay provincial government will order residents in risky areas to leave their homes, Gremil Naz, a local disaster official, told DZBB radio station.Earlier this week, Typhoon Molave killed 22 people in the Philippines -- mostly through drowning in provinces south of the capital Manila, which is also in the projected path of Goni.Authorities are facing another hurdle as social distancing needs to be imposed in evacuation centers to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The Philippines has the second-highest number of Covid-19 infections and deaths in Southeast Asia, behind only Indonesia.Relief goods, heavy machinery and personal protective equipment are already positioned in key areas, Filipino Grace America, mayor of Infanta town in Quezon province, told DZBB radio. "But because of the Covid-19 pandemic, our funds for calamity concerns and expenses are insufficient," she said.Local officials canceled port operations and barred fishers from setting sail.Typhoon Goni, moving westward at 20 kph (12 mph) from the Pacific Ocean, will bring intense rains over the capital and 14 provinces nearby on Saturday evening, and threats of floods and landslides.Another typhoon, Atsani, is gaining strength just outside the Philippines. Around 20 typhoons hit the Philippines every year.Editor's Note: Gaby Goldstein is co-founder and political director at the Sister District Project, which works to build progressive power in state legislatures.

This year more than ever, the entire ballot matters.Every state legislative district and congressional district will be redrawn next year based on the 2020 census. In most states, the winners of state legislative elections will be in the driver's seat for redrawing their states' maps -- which will, in turn, determine who controls the next 10 years on voting rights, gun safety, police accountability, Covid-19 recovery and so much more. Consider this tale of two states that illustrates the power of gerrymandering and the real-life consequences of rigged maps that impede the people's will -- but also provides a call to action and hope about what can be accomplished when maps are fair and the people's will is fulfilled.First, the caution. In 2018, Wisconsin voters delivered a clear message: They re-elected a Democrat to the US Senate, replaced incumbent GOP Gov. Scott Walker with a Democrat, and swept the other statewide offices, even flipping the attorney general and treasurer's office from red to blue. Wisconsin voters also favored Democratic candidates over Republicans for the state Assembly by more than 200,000 votes. But the state's wildly gerrymandered map, engineered by Republicans to retain control even during such a big Democratic wave, held strong: The GOP won just 46% of the vote, but nevertheless retained 64% of the seats. Democrats gained a single seat.Wisconsin's state legislature, controlled by politicians insulated from the voters they are supposed to represent, has met the challenges of today with indifference to their constituents' policy priorities and even their health. As Covid-19 raged across Wisconsin in April, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers called a special session, asking the legislature to postpone a statewide election until mid-May and to conduct all voting by mail. The assembly took 17 seconds to adjourn without any action. Last November, when Evers ordered a special session on expanding background checks for guns -- a measure supported by 80%  of Wisconsin residents, according to a Marquette University Law School poll -- both chambers convened, then immediately adjourned without debate. When Evers called a special session in August on police reform after a Kenosha police officer shot Jacob Blake, a Black man, seven times while his back was to them, the GOP-controlled legislature disdainfully convened for all of 30 seconds.Now, for the hope. Virginia's legislative action in 2020 stands in sharp contrast to the stiff-arm by Wisconsin's gerrymandered legislature. It demonstrates how leaders can respond to crises with broadly popular action when the courts declare a rigged map unconstitutional and replace it with one that's fair. In 2019, after the Supreme Court let stand a federal court decision that forced several districts in Virginia's legislature to be redrawn because of illegal racial gerrymandering, the map that had delivered GOP majorities despite hundreds of thousands of fewer votes was redrawn by a neutral special master. That fall, when Democrats won more votes, it finally resulted in a majority of seats. Change ensued. Virginia's lawmakers expanded voting rights, adopted no-excuse absentee voting, broadened vote-by-mail options, declared Election Day a state holiday and instituted same-day voter registration. They moved common-sense gun regulation, including universal background checks and new requirements to report a stolen weapon and keep loaded firearms away from kids. They also tackled police accountability head-on, banning sexual relations between officers and arrestees, requiring decertification for cops who violate the law, strengthening citizen review panels, including false 911 calls as hate crimes, and prohibiting no-knock warrants. The legislature also passed a raft of Covid-19 relief including expanding telehealth, prohibiting price gouging, bolstering tenants' rights and ensuring that kids continue to get free breakfast and lunch at school. The contrast between the actions of Wisconsin's and Virginia's legislatures could not be clearer. This is why maps matter, and why state legislatures matter. Those maps, and those state legislatures, are now on the ballot again. Redistricting takes place every 10 years, after the census, so it's coming up next year. While most of the national attention is directed at the race for the White House and control of the US Senate, much quieter races for control of state legislative chambers are every bit as important for our everyday lives. The legislatures elected this fall will have outsized importance on shaping the next decade in states like Texas, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Florida and Wisconsin. What's at stake is nothing less than what representative democracy looks like in battleground states: Whether one party will have the ability to hold durable legislative majorities for another decade even with a minority of votes, to enact an extreme policy agenda most voters oppose, and to limit voting rights in states that control more than 100 Electoral College votes.  Republicans dominated this process after the 2010 elections and weaponized redistricting into a blunt partisan weapon.  The echoes of 2010's Republican state legislative triumph are still felt today: Before Virginia flipped blue last year, nearly 60 million Americans lived in a state where one or both chambers of the state legislature is controlled by the party that won fewer votes in 2018, according to a USC Schwarzenegger Institute study.  If you guessed that Democrats won more votes in all of those states yet Republicans maintained control anyway, you would be correct.Many of us see President Donald Trump's contempt for democracy and worry about a further entrenchment of minority rule if he wins a second term. But the much more consequential races for determining what our nation is to look like for the next decade, even the next generation, are these elections in state legislatures. And with conservatives likely to hold a 6-3 majority on the US Supreme Court over this decade, or longer, these state legislatures become a crucial last line of defense for health care, voting rights, reproductive rights, and much more.The next president, after all, will serve until 2024. But voters won't get another crack at fairer maps until 2031. If we allow the opportunity to build progressive power in states to pass this November, our current state of minority rule will deepen and this nation will look much different by then.(CNN) - Rapper Lil Wayne met with President Donald Trump to discuss the President's plan for Black Americans -- and apparently liked what he heard. Lil Wayne praised Trump in a tweet Thursday and shared a photo of the two men giving a thumbs up."Just had a great meeting with @realdonaldtrump @potus besides what he's done so far with criminal reform, the platinum plan is going to give the community real ownership," the rapper tweeted. "He listened to what we had to say today and assured he will and can get it done."Trump's "platinum plan" is geared toward Black voters and includes a number of broad initiatives like building neighborhoods with the "highest policing standards," expanding school choice and improving economic opportunity for Black Americans. When the President unveiled the plan in late September, though, he did not specify what those economic initiatives for Black Americans would entail. Earlier this month, rapper Ice Cube, who once vowed he'd never endorse Trump, announced he was working with the President on developing his plan for Black voters. Ice Cube defended his position on Twitter, saying he'd "advise anyone on the planet who has the power to help Black Americans close the enormous wealth gap."It's unclear whether Lil Wayne is advising the President in a similar role. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Thursday that Trump met Carter in Miami that day after Carter's team reached out to the White House. CNN has reached out to Lil Wayne for comment on his meeting with Trump. Both Lil Wayne and the President have made widely criticized remarks regarding racial justice. Trump, earlier this year, called Black Lives Matter "a symbol of hate" and accused the movement of provoking killings of police officers. In 2016, Carter was criticized for an interview with "Nightline" when he said he didn't feel "connected" to the Black Lives Matter movement."I don't feel connected to a damn thing that ain't got nothin' to do with me," he said at the time.Lil Wayne has mostly avoided commenting on racial justice issues since, though in May, he hosted Dr. Anthony Fauci on his Apple Music radio show to discuss the pandemic's impact on Black Americans. The rapper asked Fauci if it was true African Americans were dying at a much higher rate than others in the US. Fauci told him it was, and explained why.(CNN) - A rare metallic asteroid about three times farther away from the sun than our planet could yield secrets about Earth's molten core, and scientists want to learn all about it. A new study published Monday in The Planetary Science Journal takes a closer look at this mysterious asteroid, using data from the Hubble Telescope. Located between Mars and Jupiter, Asteroid 16 Psyche is one of the most massive objects in the asteroid belt in our solar system, and with a diameter of about 140 miles, it is roughly the same length as Massachusetts (if you exclude Cape Cod). The exact composition of Psyche is still unclear, but scientists think it's possible the asteroid is mostly made of iron and nickel. It's been hypothesized that a piece of iron of its size could be worth about $10,000 quadrillion, more than the entire economy on our planet. Scientists believe that Psyche could be the metallic core of an early planet that lost its mantle and crust due to collisions that might have occurred early in the formation of the solar system. In 2022, NASA will send an unmanned spacecraft to Psyche to study it up close and better determine its composition. In the meantime, the new study in The Planetary Science Journal looked at Psyche through the Hubble Telescope at two specific points in its rotation, to capture both sides of the asteroid. The study includes the first ultraviolet observations of Psyche, furthering our understanding of its surface and its possible composition."We looked at the way that the ultraviolet light reflected off of the asteroid surface," Tracy Becker told CNN. She is the lead author of the study and a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute."The way the ultraviolet light was reflected from Psyche was very, very similar to the way iron reflects sunlight," she explained.The importance of studying PsycheStudying Psyche could help us better understand those early times in the history of our solar system, when objects would have had "higher inclinations and crazier eccentricities," and would have had more opportunities to collide with each other, Becker told CNN.If Psyche is the metal core of a planet that never was, studying it more closely could tell us a lot about the core of our planet, which we wouldn't be able to explore, Becker said.The study also detected two possible signals of changes to the surface of Psyche due to solar winds, according to Becker."The first one was that as we went deeper into the UV, we started to see the asteroid get brighter, which is pretty rare," Becker said."In the past, when we've seen that on certain planetary bodies, including the moon, that often tells us that it's due to the charge particles from the sun interacting with the materials on the surface, causing this brightening. We call that space weathering," she added.The second signal, according to Becker, was the detection of iron oxide ultraviolet absorption bands. "That could be implying that there is some sort of interaction with oxygen and the metal," Becker said. The oxygen could be coming from the sun or it could be already present in the materials that are on the asteroid, according to Becker. Further study will be required to connect these findings to more information on when the asteroid first might have formed, Becker said.Getting ready to visit PsycheThe study comes as the NASA mission to Psyche, led by Arizona State University, is plugging away."We're building space hardware and getting ready for our launch in August of 2022," Lindy Elkins-Tanton, a planetary scientist who is the principal investigator for the mission, told CNN. Elkins-Tanton is also a minor author of the new study.The mission's launch, originally slated for 2023, was moved up to 2022, and will take place from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, using a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket.The unmanned spacecraft should reach Psyche by January 2026, and it will be orbiting the asteroid for 21 months, mapping it and studying it from a distance, Elkins-Tanton explained. When it gets to Psyche, the mission will be the first to ever photograph the asteroid. Scientists plan on making these images immediately available for everyone on Earth to see and study further, possibly within 30 minutes of taking them, Elkins-Tanton said. "Everyone in the world is going to be able to look at Psyche at the same time we are, and scratch their heads and say, what is this thing?" she added.What we want to know about PsycheElkins-Tanton said she is thrilled about the scientific community's interest in learning more about Psyche ahead of the mission, which will be a true test for the theories about the asteroid put forth so far."There's the opportunity for people to make measurements, hypotheses and predictions, and then actually find out if they're right, because we're going to go and find out," she added.The questions Elkins-Tanton hopes to find answers to could help us understand "the ingredients that went into making the cake" -- that is, our planet."Does [Psyche] have oxygen mixed into it, the way this study has indicated it might have some? Or other light elements, like sulfur, or even potassium, mixed into the metal phase? Can we say something about the temperature and pressure conditions under which it formed, based on its composition, that would tell us something about the size of the body it came from, and the sorts of things that went into making up our Earth?""One thing we can pretty much promise right now is that Psyche is going to surprise us," Elkins-Tanton said. "Everything we know about it now is probably going to be wrong when we go there and find out."A $10,000 quadrillion asteroidAbout that staggering estimate that Psyche might be worth $10,000 quadrillion, Elkins-Tanton says she takes responsibility for coming up with that number during interviews when the NASA mission was first announced in 2017. While the conversation on mining asteroids for resources is developing here on Earth, Psyche is not the target we should strive for, according to Elkins-Tanton."We cannot bring Psyche back to Earth. We have absolutely no technology to do that," Elkins-Tanton said. Even if it was possible to bring back metals from Psyche without destroying the Earth, that would quite possibly collapse the markets, Elkins-Tanton said."There are all kinds of problems with this, but it's still fun to think about what a piece of metal the size of Massachusetts would be worth."Space mining and our imaginationObjects that are closer to Earth are more realistic candidates for space mining, according to Elkins-Tanton. One of the most interesting ideas is to use asteroids as a source for water, which can be made into rocket fuel."Most of the nearest asteroids don't have water ice on them, but they do have minerals that contain water bound up in their crystal lattices," and that could be accessed by heating up the minerals, Elkins-Tanton explained. "They could almost be like little refueling stations," she said."This is a bit ahead of ourselves in terms of what we can actually do, but I love it because it shows how aspirational people can be, and it shows how powerful our imaginations are," Elkins-Tanton told CNN. "To me, that's the great strength of space exploration -- it gives us that motivation to do great things," she added.(CNN) - It might seem a little random that the Goo Goo Dolls are releasing a holiday album.But for lead singer John Rzeznik, it's simple."I love Christmas," he told CNN in a recent interview. Rzeznik, who rose to fame in the '90s as the frontman for the alternative rock band has had a string of chart topping hits like "Iris," "Slide" and "Name." So, why plunge into the already crowded holiday music genre? Rzeznik said besides just loving the holiday season, and the Covid-19 pandemic is what inspired him and collaborators Brad Fernquist and Jimmy McGormato to take the leap."In my opinion 2020 has been one of the worst years ever and I think a lot of people just need something to lift their spirits be it a little sentimental or cheesy in spots," Rzeznik said. "I wanted it to be completely different from what people expected from us."The album, "It's Christmas All Over," features 10 tracks, which include familiar classics like "Let It Snow," along with two originals "This is Christmas" and "You Ain't Getting Nothin.'" The latter, he says, was inspired by his three-year-old daughter. "All the old classic Christmas albums were what we were brought up with Dean Martin, Burl Ives those kinds of things. My absolute favorite singer of Christmas songs is Nat King Cole, I just love his voice. I could never sing like that but he's just always the one. His voice just has this gravity to it just sucks you in."Rzeznik formed the Goo Goo Dolls in 1985 alongside bassist Robby Takac, and drummer George Tutuska and since then the group has had a steady flow of albums and tours. But for the first time Rzeznik says he's been forced to press pause and reflect."I feel this real sense of gratitude that I've actually been able to have a career and have more than one song that people know. I'm really proud of that," he said. "You know, those songs gave me a life and a way to take care of my family ... and it's fun. I never thought in a million years that I would ever get to play music for a living. That's something that never fades from me."Related: The Goo Goo Dolls' lead singer supports small businesses impacted by coronavirusRzeznik acknowledges the country is strained and politically divided but believes music can still unite us."The country is so divided but people from all walks of life, a few thousand of them will go into a room and listen to you sing and sing back with you and no body is really thinking about what's going on [in the world]," he said. "People are just relaxing and having a good time. It's not a red state versus blue state, mask versus no mask. People from every political stripe everywhere just get together and they have one thing in common and that's music that they enjoy."(CNN) - Growing up as an adopted child in Ireland in the mid-1960s, Noelle Brown didn't ask questions about her past.  It wasn't until 2002 that a chat with a friend prompted her to think that it might be time to investigate the circumstances around her birth. Brown contacted a charity, which pointed her towards a nun it said could help. But she said the nun dodged her calls for months. When she finally picked up the phone, Brown says she was "rudely" told -- with no further explanation -- that she wasn't entitled to her personal information, but that she could come for counseling.  "I took it for granted that all I had to do was ask [for my information]," Brown told CNN. "I didn't realize I was setting off a chain of events that has taken up 20 years of my life." More than 190,000 women and children are estimated to have been placed in mother and baby homes and "county homes" -- institutions where unmarried women were sent to deliver their babies in secret across Ireland for nearly eight decades. Like many of the estimated 57,000 former survivors of those homes, Brown has struggled to find out what happened during her time in one of them.  On Friday, the five-year Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters -- established to investigate what transpired across 14 mother and baby homes and four county homes from 1922 to 1998 -- is set to finalize its report. It's unclear when it will be made public, but the government has said it plans to publish it as soon as possible.Survivors like Brown have long hoped that the commission would reveal more about allegations of arbitrary detention, cruelty and neglect, forced adoption and vaccine trials that went on inside the homes, as well as hold wrongdoers to account.They also hoped it would help them to access their personal records, including information about missing relatives and babies buried in unmarked graves.Now, those hopes have been boosted by a dramatic U-turn from the Irish government on Wednesday evening, less than a week after passing a law that promised to seal the commission's archive from survivors and the public for 30 years.Minister for Children and Youth Affairs Roderic O'Gorman had initially said that the law was bound by the Commissions of Investigations Act 2004 "whose purpose is to protect a database created by the commission." But following a groundswell of public opposition rallying against the law, the government changed its position, saying that survivors of the homes are legally entitled to access their personal data.Critics of the law had successfully argued that sealing the commission's records was illegal under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an EU directive which gives individuals the right to access their data. In a statement on Wednesday evening, the government said it "acknowledges and regrets the genuine hurt felt by many people across Irish society," and that it is "determined to take necessary actions to ensure that these concerns are dealt with in a manner that is timely, appropriate and that the focus is on the needs of victims and survivors."A conglomerate of groups representing survivors and survivor advocates warmly welcomed the announcement.Brown, who was denied access to her own files for decades, is cautiously optimistic. 'Emotionally battering' Brown was born at the notorious Bessborough home in County Cork. She was adopted into a loving family and grew up just a half a mile away from the home, but more than 900 babies born or admitted to Bessborough died in infancy or early childhood, either there or in a nearby hospital.Infant mortality rates there peaked at 82% in 1944, and only 64 of the 900 babies' graves have ever been located. In an interim report released last year, the commission said it found it "very difficult to understand" that no members of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary the nuns who ran the home, were able to say where the other graves were.  In the same report, the commission found that 973 children died at, or near, the Tuam mother and baby home. The remains of some of them were found inside a decommissioned sewage tank. Only 50 burial records have been located; others "may have been lost or destroyed over the years."     The commission also found that between 1920 and 1977, the bodies of more than 950 children who died in some of the homes were sent to university medical schools for "anatomical studies."  In 2017, as the commission was taking testimony from survivors, Brown says she decided to ask Tusla -- the country's child and family agency -- for the rest of her records, since she only had very basic information -- including her mother's name -- from a previous attempt to find out about the circumstances around her birth and her time in the home. The agency sent her a copy of her records, but it was almost entirely redacted -- both of her parents' names were among the blacked-out sections. It wasn't until she appeared on television to discuss a play she had written about the search for her birth mother that Brown says the agency admitted it had her father's name and address; it said it would contact him on her behalf -- but only after a further two-and-a-half year waiting period. Brown says she had little faith that the agency would really reach out to her birth father, so she paid for a DNA test in 2019. Just six weeks later, she was able to connect with her birth father's family -- but they delivered the devastating news that he had died in 2016. Brown's mother, too, had died before she was able to trace her.  "They (Tusla) cost me that time," Brown said, adding that having to fight for every scrap of information was "a really emotionally battering experience." In 2017, when Brown brought her testimony to the commission, she said they insisted her name be anonymized, even though she wanted it on the record. The commission later told her it would not investigate her story, she said, instead directing her back to Tusla. When the agency learned that Brown had found her parents' names through a third party, she said a staffer there told her: "Well sure, didn't it all work out in the end?"Tusla's head of communications told CNN before the government announcement that the agency was unable to comment on individual cases, but that it "recognizes the many challenges for people dealing with very sensitive questions in the areas of information and tracing." CNN reached out to Tusla for additional comment following Wednesday's news. To avoid future roadblocks like what Brown experienced in her quest for information, advocacy rights groups The Adoption Rights Alliance, Justice for Magdalenes Research and the Clann Project called on the government on Thursday to ensure independent data protection experts will be appointed to assist survivors seeking their access going into the future. Sinéad Ring, assistant professor of law at Maynooth University and an expert on transitional justice told CNN: "law and justice aim to achieve closure for all parties, but we can't have any closure when survivors feel excluded from the process." She added that the commission could have decided to hold public hearings, given that some survivors wished to make their stories public. The Commission did not address CNN's question about why it refused to hold public hearings despite having the power to do so.Other survivors who testified to the commission have been refused access to their transcripts.  But the government's reversal now demonstrates that the reflexive urge to keep things secret isn't compatible under EU law -- or a modern Ireland.To demonstrate this, the government said it is now committed to establishing a national archive of records related to institutional trauma during the 20th century, including an archive of survivor testimony.The survivor advocacy groups said it was an opportunity for the country to establish a "world-leading, inclusive approach to acknowledging and documenting our history of institutional and gender-related abuse.""Nobody can be left behind," they said. (CNN) - Loving gift or creepy?That's the debate social media is having about Kanye West gifting his wife Kim Kardasian West with a hologram of her late father for her 40th birthday.While Kardashian West tweeted how touched she and her family were by being able to see and hear from the lifelike image of the late Robert Kardashian, the use of such technology to resurrect some famous folks has been a sore spot.In 2012, some fans were a little freaked out by the late rapper Tupac "performing" at Coachella as a hologram.The technology has come a long way since then, and in 2018 plans for a tour featuring an Amy Winehouse hologram seven years after the then 27-year-old Grammy winner died of accidental alcohol poisoning caused some major ire.And Winehouse's image was not the only one.Musicians Roy Orbinson and Buddy Holly also got the hologram treatment, and "An Evening With Whitney: The Whitney Houston Hologram Tour" kicked off in Europe earlier this year but had to be canceled because of the pandemic. Of course, a birthday gift to one of the world's most famous reality stars is very different from a concert tour featuring a dead celebrity, and Kardashian West clearly loved the gesture."I can't even describe what this meant to me and my sisters, my brother, my mom and closest friends to experience together," she tweeted. "Thank you so much Kanye for this memory that will last a lifetime."The Kardashian patriarch was a famous lawyer who died in 2003 after being diagnosed with esophageal cancer(CNN) - If "Baby Yoda" (a.k.a. "The Child") was the big surprise when "The Mandalorian" made its debut a year ago, the second season arrives amid sky-high expectations that seemed difficult to fulfill. Yet the Disney+ series managed to deliver on them with its premiere, which featured numerous creatures and aliens looping back into the mythology of the original trilogy, and yes, another flourish designed to set the Internet ablaze.One of the most impressive aspects of the first season involved the show's ability to tap into "Star Wars" nostalgia while charting its own creative path. Another hinged on executive producers Jon Favreau (who wrote and directed the premiere) and Dave Filoni possessing an innate feel for the way those early films mixed cinematic genres, adapting that into a series format imbued with the same combination of old and new.The second-season opener particularly reflected the franchise's western roots, with the Mandalorian (voiced by Pedro Pascal) and his young sidekick coming to a remote town on a familiar planet, where he's forced into an alliance with the local marshal (guest Timothy Olyphant, adding another lawman to his resume) to face a very big threat.That framework draws upon everything that fans have come to enjoy -- and frequently miss and grouse about when it falls short -- regarding "Star Wars," including theatrical-quality visual effects, bountiful action and humor."The Mandalorian" has also proven adept at crafting largely self-contained episodes while gradually advancing the larger story line. The same goes for focusing on these specific characters while delivering references and moments immersed in "Star Wars" trivia, in a way that surely would elicit whoops and hollers were it presented to an assembled audience.For now, with the theatrical business hobbled and the "Star Wars" galaxy essentially between movies -- waiting to see what director Taika Waititi can conjure after the completion of the most recent trilogy -- Disney+ has, practically speaking, become "Star Wars'" home base."The Mandalorian" is already a key asset for the studio, including all the merchandise Baby Yoda appears destined to sell heading into the holidays. Far from resting on its laurels, though, if the balance of Season 2 can match the promise of this first episode, it's still easy to have a good feeling about this."The Mandalorian" is currently streaming on Disney+.(CNN) - Jeff Bridges is thanking everyone who has supported him since he shared his lymphoma diagnosis. On Thursday, the acclaimed actor posted on his verified social media accounts a photo of himself posing in a hospital gown while hooked up to a portable IV."I want to thank you all for reaching out during this time, it feels good getting all the well wishes and love!" the caption on Instagram read. "I'll be sharing more updates on my site."Over on his personal site Bridges wrote, "This cancer thing is bringing on feelings of preciousness, and gratitude, and good old fashion love, and lots of it, big time.""I'm feeling so much of it comin' my way, and man, I appreciate it," he wrote. "It's contagious, all this love, like some kind of positive virus."The 70-year-old actor said he will be sharing his perspective on his site and asked his followers to contribute to that."I'm looking to be in partnership with you guys in creating a beautiful life & world for all of us," he wrote. "All in this together." New York  (CNN Business) - It has been a messy week for the stock market. With only four days to go until Election Day, rising Covid-19 infections and uncertainty about further government stimulus to help the economy, there's plenty for investors to worry about.The Dow is on track for its worst week since March, when the market tumbled under the first wave of coroanvirus infections and lockdowns. We're not back in lockdown mode yet, but in Europe, countries have tightened restrictions again to combat a second wave.The Dow opened down 0.4%, or 109 points, on Friday.The S&P 500, which is the broadest measure of Wall Street, is looking a bit better -- but not by much. The index kicked the day off 0.5% lower, and it's on track for its worst week since at least June. But if losses accelerate it could be its worst since March as well.The Nasdaq Composite opened 0.8% lower, putting it on pace for its worst week since September.Big tech is looking less enticing Friday as well. Apple and Amazon, which reported earnings late Thursday, saw their shares tumble at the market open.(CNN) - With the threat of Covid-19, trick-or-treating may not be safe this year and kids should be kept home, three professors from the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine warned in written statements on Wednesday. "I'm more hesitant to even do socially distanced activities with large group(s) of kids and adults gathering outdoors. People are trying to come up with creative ways of passing out candy. But I'd be worried for potential spread from any contact with people outside your household," Dr. Sadiya Khan, a physician, epidemiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said in her statement."Being within six feet of somebody who isn't part of your household, even if outdoors, is risky now. Door-to-door trick-or-treating is very hard to do safely, because there has to be good masking and physical distancing of at least six feet or more," Khan said, adding that her children plan to dress up in costumes and she'll hide candy around the house for them to find.Those warnings may be having an impact. Only 12% of US households will go trick-or-treating this year, versus 24% who went in 2019, according to a new Spotlight on Education survey from NORC at the University of Chicago. One in four families said they are still going to give out candy this year, down significantly from last year's 38% rate.Most people who celebrate will carve pumpkins or watch scary movies at home, but some 41% will not celebrate at all -- up 10% from last year, the survey reports. "In many places, Halloween is a community event that brings together friends, family, schools, and neighbors," said Shazia Miller, senior vice president of NORC's Education and Child Development department, in a statement. "Like many things in 2020, COVID-19 will disrupt this cultural celebration and represents another loss of community during the pandemic."Some 41% of parents report their children are angry or disappointed about their canceled Halloween plans. That doesn't mean Halloween is completely canceled. Modified plansDr. Craig Garfield, professor of pediatrics and medical social science at Northwestern's Feinberg and director of the Family and Child Health Innovations Program at the Children's Hospital of Chicago, suggested in his statement that parents modify their plans. Hiding candy around the house -- which Garfield called "trick-or-treat meets hide-and-go-seek" -- can be a safe alternative to traditional trick-or-treating."Much as I love the costumes and candy of Halloween, this year we will not go out and will not be turning on lights or giving out candy. I suggest other families do the same," Garfield said in his statement. "Now is a time to just stay together as a family."Overall, the lowest-risk way to celebrate Halloween is to stay indoors with your household, said Dr. Taylor Heald-Sargent, pediatrician and assistant professor of pediatrics at the university medical school."The bottom line is that there is a risk, and it's simpler to just cancel everything. But everyone is getting tired of skipping fun events and disappointing our children," Heald-Sargent said in her statement. "It's essential to follow the three W's: wear a mask, watch your distance and wash your hands."Heald-Sargent added that instead of handing out candy this year, she used the money she would have spent on candy to buy individually wrapped face masks to leave outside instead.(CNN) - A 7.0-magnitude earthquake hit the Aegean Sea off Greece and Turkey on Friday, according to the United States Geological Survey.At least six buildings have been destroyed in the Turkish cities of Izmir, Bornova and Bayrakli following the tremor, the Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said on Twitter.There were no reports of loss of life yet in the Turkish cities impacted."Our teams continue their screening and interventions in the field" he said.This is a developing story.Nairobi  (CNN) - Covid-19 cases are accelerating in some parts of Africa and governments should step up preparations for a second wave, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday.Over the past four week, cases have increased by 45% per week on average in Kenya, by 19% in Democratic Republic of Congo and by 8% in Egypt, the African Union-run organization's head John Nkengasong said."The time to prepare for a second wave is truly now," he said, urging governments "not to get into prevention fatigue mode."The continent of 1.3 billion people has so far managed better than widely expected in terms of containing the epidemic, with a lower percentage of deaths than other regions, partly due to strict lockdown measures imposed in March.There have been 41,776 deaths among the 1.74 million people reported infected with the virus, according to a Reuters tally based on official data as of Thursday morning.Beginning in August, many governments eased restrictions, however, and a trend of decreasing cases has flattened, Matshidiso Moeti, Africa director for the WHO said in an online press conference on Thursday.In Kenya, the government allowed bars to reopen on September 28 and cut the nightly curfew by two hours. Schools partially reopened on October 12.Some easing was justified to help economies in the region to start recovering, Moeti said. However, "we will need to be dealing with some of these upticks. What is important is to contain them."Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday announced a November 4 summit to review the surge in infections, and urged Kenyans to wear face masks properly and practice social distancing to avoid "losing hard-fought for ground" in the fight against the disease.Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari warned Thursday that his country's economy was "too fragile" to bear another lockdown. "Looking at the trends in the other countries, we must do all we can to avert a second wave of Covid-19 in Nigeria," he said in a tweet. "We must make sure that our cases, which have gone down, do not rise again." In the World Health Organization's situation update for the region on October 21, it encouraged member states to "observe all precautionary measures diligently and comprehensively."(CNN) - More than 6 million ballots have already been cast in four pivotal Midwest states: Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin.President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden will both appear in Minnesota and Wisconsin on Friday. In addition, Trump will stop in Michigan and Biden will appear in Iowa.    All four states are among CNN's most competitively rated. With four days until November 3, here's a deeper look at who's already voted in these key states, with data from Catalist, a company that provides data, analytics and other services to Democrats, academics and nonprofit issue-advocacy organizations.    IowaThe Hawkeye state voted twice for the Obama-Biden ticket but then backed Trump-Pence by almost 10 points over Hillary Clinton in 2016. Polls show a tight race.  Democrats currently have a 16-point advantage over Republicans in the pre-Election Day vote. At this time four years ago, they led Republicans by just 10 points. This is not indicative of any outcome, as the GOP holds a slight edge in voter registration in the state, and polls show many Republicans nationwide prefer to vote on Election Day. Voters under 30 make up 11% of all early voters so far -- up four points from this time last cycle. Voters 30-64 are up five points from 43% of turnout at this point four years ago to 48% now. Voters 65 and older make up a smaller share of early voters than at this point four years ago. The racial breakdown of Iowa's early voting electorate remains consistent with this point in 2016, with White voters making up the vast majority -- 94% -- of those who have already cast ballots.  MichiganTrump earned Michigan's 16 electoral votes four years ago with a 0.2% margin of victory. This year, Biden and Democrats are fighting to rebuild the so-called Blue Wall. Before Trump's win, the state hadn't voted for a Republican presidential nominee since 1988. The state expanded mail voting as an option to all voters in this year's election. Currently, 10% of voters so far in the state are under 30 -- at this point four years ago, only 3% were. While voters 65 or older made up 78% of early voters in 2016, they make up 44% of early voters so far this year.  Black voters in Michigan have increased their share of ballots already cast compared to four years ago. They account for about 12% of those early votes so far, up from 8% at this point in 2016. White voters still represent the majority of those who've already cast ballots, although their share has decreased from 89% last cycle to about 83% currently. MinnesotaBoth Trump and Biden will make stops in Minnesota on Friday, a state Hillary Clinton won by less than two points in 2016. The President sees the state as a possible opportunity to expand the map this year, even though no Republican presidential nominee has won here since 1972.   Young voters make up 12% of early voters in Minnesota, more than twice the 5% share they had at this point in 2016.  Black voters, Asian voters and Hispanic voters in Minnesota have seen one-percentage point upticks in their shares of ballots already cast compared to this time in 2016.  White voters currently comprise a slightly smaller percentage of those early votes at 88%, down from 92% four years ago. WisconsinTrump won the Badger State by less than one point in 2016, breaking a Democratic presidential streak dating back to 1988.   Wisconsin has seen a large decrease in the share of early votes from people 65 or older, but the state hasn't seen as much of an increase from voters under 30. Seniors went from 48% of the early vote in 2016 to 36% now. Voters under 30 made up only 4% of pre-Election Day voters four years ago but now make up 5%. The largest increase has actually come from voters with unknown ages. Those voters made up 5% of early voters four years ago, but now make up about 12%.   The breakdown of Wisconsin's early voters by race remains similar to that of four years ago. White voters represent a significant majority of those early votes at about 89%, followed by Black voters at 5%. Washington, DC  (CNN) - Taylor Swift's song "Only the Young," is featured in a new ad from California Rep. Eric Swalwell encouraging young voters to get out to the polls in the final days of the 2020 campaign.Swalwell tweeted the ad Friday with the message, "Thank you @taylorswift13, for voicing what #OnlyTheYoung can do. Let's run!"The ad, which will be distributed over social media in the final days of the 2020 campaign, marks the first time that Swift has licensed a song to a campaign, the Swalwell campaign said.The ad features images from marches and protests over the past four years, calling attention to the Covid-19 pandemic, racial injustice, the climate crisis, and immigration. It also includes audio and video footage of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris. Swalwell, who is running for re-election in California, says he first heard Swift's "Only the Young" song in January when Swift released her Miss Americana Documentary on Netflix.To Swalwell, the song is, "an anthem for 2020 and a call to action for the youth vote," he told CNN.According to the California Democrat, his campaign sent Taylor Swift a "cold pitch," last Friday asking for permission to use Swift's "Only The Young" song in its new ad. While Swalwell did not speak to Swift personally, the Swalwell campaign was granted permission to use her song."They responded quickly and worked with us to get what's called a gratis license," Sawalwell said, which means that Swift allowed the Swalwell campaign to use the song free of charge.Swalwell said he believes youth voter turnout could be "consequential" in the 2020 election, noting that "our health in this pandemic, our future as far as this economy that's been brought to its knees, and healing the country over racial injustice," are at stake.Those issues are resonating with young people, Swalwell told CNN.He said he hopes having the song in the ad, which includes the lyrics, "Only the young can run," will motivate young voters to get out to the polls this weekend and on Election Day."They've marched for years on these issues," Swalwell told CNN. "The song calls on people to run, and essentially run to the polls."Editor's Note: Peniel E.

View more opinion articles on CNN.(CNN) - This year has laid bare, for all the world to see, the depth and breadth of racial injustice in American society. Regardless of the election outcome, transformational change must be the next step, with racial justice advocates helping all of us to re-imagine American democracy and calling on leaders to repurpose national policy ambitions in service of these goals. From the disparate impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in BIPOC (Black Indigenous People of Color) communities to the disproportionately cruel effects of the economic on Black families (more likely to suffer from unemployment, lack of health insurance, housing and food insecurity, and poverty), the protests and outcry ongoing since the killing of George Floyd have cast a spotlight that cannot be dimmed. None of this is to say that America's fate will be the same no matter who wins the presidential election. Nothing could be further from the truth. But it is imperative to consider what a victory for President Donald Trump would cost every American when it comes to race -- and likewise crucial to think about what would be required, should Joe Biden win, to make his promises of progress into a reality.  Philadelphia has become the latest battleground for racial justice this week in the wake of the police shooting of 27-year-old William Wallace Jr., a mentally ill Black man holding a knife, who officers shot and killed this past Monday. Demonstrations ranging from peaceful to violent have roiled the city days before the election, casting a spotlight on police use of force against Black people and the need for structural reform of the criminal justice system. The past two nights of civil unrest in Philadelphia highlight the fact that struggles at the core of this American spring of racial protests will continue so long as the roots of the structural equality criticized by social justice advocates remains. In the last presidential debate both Donald Trump and Joe Biden confronted America's racist history in starkly divergent ways. President Trump claimed to have done more for Black America than any other president since Abraham Lincoln, a hyperbolic statement that led Biden into his best line of the evening: "Abraham Lincoln here is one of the most racist presidents in modern American history." President Trump most assuredly did not get the pointed sarcasm of Biden's response. President Trump's much-mentioned achievements on race -- his signing of the First Step Criminal Justice Reform Act and federal support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) -- are indeed worthy but must be balanced against his naked appeals to the nation's worse racial impulses. Moreover, the President's vaunted "Opportunity Zones" -- touted as offering economic investment in racially segregated and economically impoverished ghettos -- has been criticized as more of a federal boondoggle and tax haven for wealthy entrepreneurs than its supposed intended purpose. It's also far from a given that former Vice President Biden has overcome his own dubious past on race issues. Biden's progressive rhetoric on race matters during the debate and elsewhere, including his insistence that the US must deal with "systemic racism," does not exist in a vacuum. Biden's admitted it was a mistake to champion -- as good policy and better politics -- harsh "law and order" drug and crime legislation of the 1980s and 1990s; still, that does little to close this Pandora's box of a legislative legacy that continues to devastate millions of families. And what about the Biden of 2020? It's difficult for me to imagine a Biden-Harris administration that is fully committed to anti-racism at the national level. Perhaps that's because Biden's focus on increasing federal funds for police anti-bias training feels insufficient in a year where Black Lives Matter protests roiled the nation and upended the political status quo. Kamala Harris, the first Black woman nominated for vice president on a major party ticket, is a proud alum of Howard University and would be the first member of the "Divine Nine" African American fraternal and sorority groups to be vice president. Yet Harris's record as a district attorney and attorney general of a purportedly progressive city and state is a mixed one, with criminal justice reformers claiming that she too zealously incarcerated the Black poor during her tenure as San Francisco DA and has largely refused to punish cops charged with police brutality. Harris has staunchly defended her criminal justice record, touting that as California attorney general she implemented statewide implicit bias training and required body cameras of Justice Department special agent personnel in the field. "What we don't want is excessive force," Harris has argued. "Or for being Black to be considered probable cause."If the Biden-Harris campaign is victorious, racial justice advocates must lobby immediately for substantive -- not just symbolic -- presence in the administration. If the president-elect is open to having Republicans in his cabinet, as has been rumored, surely he can also have a representative with deep ties to BLM in the White House as well.  The most important aspect of a Biden presidency will be its policy ambitions. This year has shown us the interplay between local, state and federal policy on matters of criminal justice, health care, poverty, violence, and more. Reparations, student debt forgiveness, universal health care and college education, and a universal basic income should be part of a national policy debate that is centered on how best to achieve racial and economic justice in America in our lifetime. While we're imagining the future, what about a second Trump administration that, having built a presidency on racial division, becomes supportive of racial justice policies? Is that possible? Presidential adviser Jared Kushner's offensive claim that Trump wants Black people to succeed and achieve at times more than they do themselves, illustrates how difficult operating in such an environment might be for civil rights and social justice advocates.  Perhaps a President Trump who is buffeted by Democratic majorities in the House and Senate could be willing to sign off on wealth creation legislation that could transform the way in which banks and financial institutions treat Blacks individually and collectively.  Financial reform that recognizes the historical role played by public and private financial institutions in maintaining Black poverty from racial slavery to the present could be a game changer that underscores the Republican Party's long-standing rhetoric of being the champions of the entrepreneurial class. The Movement For Black Lives has, in this year of unprecedented tragedy and resolve, asked America to use its imagination in revolutionary ways. Calls to reimagine public safety by investing in mental health, employment, housing affordability, and violence disruption in Black communities have become more a part of the political mainstream than ever before. Important local victories have been won in cities such as Austin, Texas. Corporate declarations in support of racial justice reached new peaks during the summer, part of a national discourse on race and democracy that has caused many Americans to rethink what their nation is built on -- and what's built upon its landscape. Monuments celebrating the Confederacy and other heroes of White supremacy and the "Lost Cause" of secession, slavery and anti-Black racism have been removed, repurposed and toppled. Now the even more difficult work begins, no matter what happens next week. Racial oppression represents an existential threat to American democracy. Like a wound ignored and allowed to fester, our national racial trauma continues to distort the present and put the future at risk. The best parts of that future will be anti-racist. The challenge ahead is forging a national consensus around the value and beauty of Black humanity, one that transcends political and party affiliation to imagine -- then realize -- the vision of a country that embraces racial justice and equity irrespective of partisan politics. New York  (CNN Business) - Dunkin' is being acquired in an $11.3 billion deal. Inspire Brands, a holding company backed by the Roark Capital Group, a private equity firm, is purchasing Dunkin', which also owns Baskin-Robbins. Inspire already owns 11,000 Arby's, Buffalo Wild Wings, Sonic, Jimmy John's and other restaurants. Inspire, which will take on Dunkin's debt in the deal, plans to acquire outstanding Dunkin' shares at $106.50 apiece. The stock was priced at $99.71 per share when the market closed on Friday.Dunkin' and Baskin-Robbins will be "complementary" to Inspire's portfolio, said Inspire CEO Paul Brown in a statement announcing the deal late Friday. He noted that through the two brands, Inspire will have access to international customers and more than 15 million loyalty program members, among other things. The purchase will almost triple Inspire's restaurant footprint: Dunkin' has more than  12,500 locations, and Baskin-Robbins has nearly 8,000.  Dunkin' CEO Dave Hoffman said in a statement that the deal will "bring meaningful value to shareholders," and that he expects it to drive growth for franchise operators. "The acquisition makes sense as it gives Inspire an established national brand with Dunkin'," wrote BTIG restaurant analyst Peter Saleh in a note published after news broke about a week ago that Dunkin' was in talks with Inspire. With Dunkin', Saleh said, Inspire's portfolio will include a chain that serves customers in the morning.In recent years Dunkin' has been emphasizing its coffee. In 2018, it dropped "Donuts" from its name and since then has invested in espresso machines and new brewing equipment. It's also tested out new breakfast items, including a plant-based sausage sandwich. Before the pandemic, breakfast was one of the few growing sectors in the fast food space. But now, breakfast sales are slumping because of the disruption to morning commutes. Many who work from home have been eating breakfast and drinking coffee at home, too. In the three months that ended on June 27, sales at US Dunkin' locations open at least a year dropped nearly 19%. But sales have been improving. In the following three months, same-store sales at US Dunkin' stores ticked up .9%. They improved from month to month in the quarter, the company said. To help turn sales around, Dunkin' made a few quick pivots. It added foods, like cream-cheese stuffed bagel minis, that would appeal to customers who visited stores in the afternoon. It also started serving its fall menu earlier in the year, and partnered with TikTok star Charli D'Amelio in a bid for younger customers. That gambit paid off: When the Charli promotion launched, Dunkin' hit a record for daily active app users. And with local and independent coffee shops struggling, bigger chains like Dunkin' could swoop in to steal market share or grow their footprints. "Dunkin' is thriving in a COVID world," said Scott Murphy, president of Dunkin' Americas, during a call discussing the company's third-quarter results. "We are excited about the future." The company has been under private ownership before. Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins were sold by Pernod Ricard SA to three private equity firms including Bain Capital, Carlyle Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners for $2.4 billion in 2005. The company went public in 2011. CNN Business' Jazmin Goodwin contributed to this report. (CNN) - NFL great Brett Favre has endorsed President Donald Trump for reelection. He's one of the most prominent figures in sports to publicly pledge support for the President.In a tweet, the former Green Bay Packers quarterback praised Trump's stances on freedom of speech, the Second Amendment, and police. "My Vote is for what makes this country great, freedom of speech & religion, 2nd Amnd, hard working tax paying citizens, police & military," he wrote. "In this election, we have freedom of choice, which all should respect. For me & these principles, my Vote is for @RealDonaldTrump." The endorsement comes a little more than a week since Favre asked Trump during a town hall how professional sports leagues should promote an anti-racism position without alienating fans.Trump, speaking from the White House, responded, "People don't want to see all of the politics. They've got enough politics with me and everybody else and they don't want to see it with football, on sports on Sunday or whenever they happen to be watching."Favre mostly avoided making political statements throughout his playing career and since retiring in 2010. But in July, he was photographed golfing with President Trump. The two "discussed the importance of sports as a critical unifying and uplifting part of the safe reopening of America," White House deputy press secretary Brian Morgenstern said, according to CNN affiliate WTMJ. The two were pictured without masks in close proximity to each other. He also appeared in an election ad for Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith in June, the Mississippi Clarion-Ledger reported. Trump gets support from NFLWhile NFL team owners have donated millions to Trump's campaign in the past, Favre is one of the few former or current NFL players to endorse the President. Earlier this week, retired NFL quarterback Jay Cutler appeared to support Trump's reelection by reposting an endorsement letter from professional golfer Jack Nicklaus with the caption "Never a doubt." Trump's relationship with the NFL has been rocky. In 2017 and 2018, he criticized Colin Kaepernick and other players who knelt during the National Anthem to protest police violence against Black Americans and said they should be fired. Earlier this year, Favre said "there's no right answer" when it comes to players kneeling during the anthem but asserted that "we should all be treated equal." "If you can't do that, you shouldn't be in America," he told USA Today in August. (CNN) - If you're one of those people who have been eagerly awaiting the chance to take a cruise out of US ports, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention released a bit of good news for you on Friday.The CDC said it's letting its no-sail order for cruise ships in US waters expire on Saturday. In its place, the CDC has issued a "Framework for Conditional Sailing Order for Cruise Ships" that starts on Sunday, November 1. But that doesn't mean lots of ships full of passengers will be sailing like it's 2019 starting next week -- the keyword in this order is "conditional." The order is a first cautious step toward the resumption of cruising in an industry that has been devastated by the Covid-19 pandemic since the no-sail order was placed March 14. Friday's order applies to cruise ships with the capacity to carry at least 250 passengers.Crew members firstThe first phase of this effort focuses not on passengers but crew members, who would be allowed to disembark from ships in territorial waters of the United States.The phased return begins while cruise ship operators build lab capacity to test crew members and future passengers. Companies must show they adhere to testing, social distancing, quarantining and isolating requirements when necessary. Later phases involves "mock voyages," with volunteers playing the role of passengers to test virus mitigation strategies on trips. Once ships have met certain requirements, they will be certified to begin operations with real passengers."This framework provides a pathway to resume safe and responsible sailing. It will mitigate the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks on ships and prevent passengers and crew from seeding outbreaks at ports and in the communities where they live," CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said in a statement. New York  (CNN Business) - No matter what happens in the 2020 election, this chapter of American history could well be called the "fake news age."One moment on January 11, 2017 crystallized it: When Trump pointed at CNN's Jim Acosta and said out loud, for the very first time, "you are fake news."Acosta was trying to ask a perfectly reasonable question about Trump and Russia. The president-elect was cornered, and he responded with the "fake news" slur.The presidential election is either a rejection of the Trump years or a four-more-years reaffirmation. If Joe Biden prevails, it will be  among a hundred other things -- a repudiation of the real-is-fake, down-is-up dynamic that has distorted American politics.So it's an opportune time to take stock of what has changed in the past four years.Trump bashed the media all throughout his 2016 campaign, but what he lacked was a "build the wall" type slogan. That's why January 11 was a turning point. Everything since  all the anti-media attacks and pro-Trump propaganda campaigns and Covid-19 denialism and assertions that you shouldn't believe your own eyes and ears  is rooted in Trump's "fake news" statement.Trump weaponized a term that already existed and turned it into a bumper sticker, an insult, a punchline. In effect he challenged every American to choose: Do you believe me or the press corps? He gave his fans an escape hatch, an all-purpose excuse, a rationalization for every bad bit of news: It's "fake." Or at least it could be, so don't stray from the pack, just trust your president and Sean Hannity and The Gateway Pundit.A consistent majority of Americans saw this technique for what it was. But Trump's fake-out succeeded in separating much of his base from the outlets historically known as the "mainstream media." In the 1,378 days of his presidency, Trump has cried "fake news" more than 2,000 times, according to Factba.se. He has tweeted it a dozen times this week.What the term 'fake news' used to meanHere, I have to confess to my own little bit of guilt. I might be one or two percent responsible for catapulting the term "fake news" onto Trump's radar in 2016. But this isn't about me  it's about the history of the term.In the 2000s Jon Stewart and "The Daily Show" were "fake news." In 2014 BuzzFeed's Craig Silverman started using the term to describe malicious made-up stories that preyed on peoples' fears. One early example tried to trick users into thinking that Ebola was spreading in Texas. Silverman is both credited and blamed for coining this definition of "fake news." And like me, he has some regrets. So I asked him to join me for a conversation on this week's "Reliable Sources" podcast, about what "fake news" was and what it has become.Silverman did a real service by identifying a very real phenomena that persists today: Made-up stories that are designed to deceive people and are primed to spread virally on social media. He and a handful of other reporters were all over this beat in 2016. I say that I share in the responsibility because, in the weeks leading up to Election Day, I used my platform on CNN to call attention to this "fake news" plague. I pointed out that there were all sorts of made-up stories spreading on Facebook and other sites, and that most of these lies ("Pope endorses Trump") were concocted to help Trump and hurt Clinton. What we didn't know was that stories were being written and distributed by Russian hackers. Others were written by Americans trying to make a quick buck with ads.After Trump won the election, "fake news" received a lot of attention. Silverman's pre-election stories suddenly gained a lot more web traffic. Some commentators even claimed that Trump voters were tricked into supporting him. To be clear, no credible news outlets actually cited "fake news" as the reason for Trump's election, but the speculation "trickled up to Trump," Silverman said. And Trump, sensitive to any suggestion that he didn't win legitimately, pulled a "jujitsu move" and called the real media "fake."What was it like for Silverman to hear Trump weaponize the term at that January 11 press conference? "It was CRAZY!" he exclaimed. And it's "a great little case study in how our information environment works." Trump redefined the term and stripped away the original context; world leaders with authoritarian tendencies used it as a cudgel; and "so our ability to actually have a focused conversation about, you know, actual fake news" was impaired.'Extreme wins'The thing that Trump does better than anything else, Silverman said, is "the exploitation of our information environment. He understood very early on that in a crowded field of candidates, and in a crowded and oversaturated information environment, extreme wins. And the stuff that was supposed to disqualify him became the things that started to bring people to him and get him the coverage and enable him to drown out everyone else."With the term "fake news," Trump "took ownership of it that day in January and just hammered it and hammered it and hammered it." That's been a through-line of the Trump years: A president and his media allies "choosing to not only attack the press with that term, but also to elevate conspiracy theories like QAnon, to consistently attack the institutions and frameworks of credible information  that's been the theme over the last four years. And that's why, in spite of platforms and funders and journalists and academics and so many aspects of society coming together to try and improve our information environment, that's why we still today have, in the United States, a more conspiratorial information environment than perhaps has ever existed in the country. And that's because of the power Trump has had and how he has chosen to use it."The conspiracy theories have continued in the closing days of Trump's re-election campaign. In recent days he has baselessly claimed that the press is hyping the Covid-19 crisis to help Biden; that the news coverage of Covid will suddenly dissipate after the election; and that Biden can't win unless the election is rigged. Silverman's biggest concern nowPlatforms like Facebook and Twitter were basically blind to the disinformation problem in 2016. They've come a long way since then, but the media environment is still really difficult and "in some ways dangerous" for "the average person to navigate," Silverman said in our podcast conversation.In 2020, there are so many more forms of disinformation. CNN has a regularly-updated guide to "false and misleading content online." This week the Washington Post and The New York Times both reported on lie-filled text messages that are making the rounds. The Times' Cade Metz said there are "increasingly widespread efforts to distribute disinformation through text messages," but the efforts are very hard to track.On big platforms like Facebook, outright falsehoods are subject to fact-checking now, and the president's posts are sometimes labeled accordingly. But hyperpartisan memes and videos and articles are what the platforms "really still don't have any way of dealing with," Silverman said, and "that is the stuff that gets people really juiced up and, you know, fires up their anger and hatred. And that stuff still travels really well." We're likely to see an inordinate amount of that content -- not false, per se, but misleading and sickening -- in the immediate aftermath of the election.(CNN) - The NFL is recommending that players not in a game or about to enter a game wear face coverings while on the sideline, as players across the league continue to test positive for Covid-19.In a memo obtained by CNN on Friday, the league's management council told teams, "A player wearing a mask during a close contact has a significantly reduced probability of being designated a "High Risk Close Contact" after an exposures to a COVID-positive individual."In a recent case of a player who tested positive two days after a game, contact tracing revealed that the player had close contacts with 17 teammates and 2 members of the team's staff, none of who were wearing masks. "Although the experts have determined that the positive player's testing history established that he was likely not contagious on game day (he had a negative test on game day as well as the days before and after), the number of potential "High Risk Close Contacts" identified by this exercise is concerning as it relates to potential exposure and transmission," according to the memo.The league is looking to work with teams to expand the bench areas in an effort to encourage physical distancing among players and staff.The NFL's main goal is to "work collectively to identify areas of vulnerability for transmit," said Chief Football Administrative Officer Dawn Aponte Friday on a conference call. Mask wearing and distancing would be critical to the success of the rest of the NFL season, she said.The recommendation comes as almost 50 players and more than 70 personnel members have tested positive for the virus since monitoring testing began on August 1. Games have had to be rescheduled, and some teams have had to temporarily suspend in-person activities due to outbreaks.On Friday, the Denver Broncos canceled practice after a player tested positive for Covid-19. In a statement, the team says the player in question is at home self-isolating as are two other teammates who have been in close contact with the unnamed player.The Broncos are set to host the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday.(CNN) - The whereabouts of an untold number of ballots in Pennsylvania's Butler County that were slated for delivery to would-be voters in next week's election remain unaccounted for, the county's director of elections said Thursday.Postal officials say they are unaware of any issues, but the director, Aaron Sheasley, said the county has received in excess of 10,000 phone calls seeking information about ballots that were requested but not received, and that some callers have called multiple times.Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race"Somewhere between the post office and the Pittsburgh sorting facility something happened," Sheasley told CNN. "We don't know what."He added, "We haven't given out any numbers because we simply don't know."Butler County is located north of Pittsburgh and has about 150,000 registered voters, said Sheasley, who said the county is "pulling out all the stops" to make sure those impacted by the issue are able to vote. County officials said in a press release Thursday that they sent out about 40,000 ballots and have had 21,300 returned so far, but it's unclear how many voters have received ballots but simply haven't returned them yet.The confusion is of particular national interest given Pennsylvania's critical role as a swing state. Butler County overwhelmingly voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 over Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, 66% to 29%, according to CNN's election results.View 2020 presidential election pollingMarti Johnson, a spokeswoman for the US Postal Service, told CNN they are unaware of any issues."Regarding mail sorting and delivery in Butler County, the Postal Service is unaware of any significant delays or issues and is in regular contact with the Board of Election as we work to locate and deliver ballots as they are presented to us," she said.And American Postal Workers Union Pittsburgh chapter president Chuck Bugar said there's "no record or indication" that the missing ballots in Butler County ever made it to the Postal Service."There's no pile of ballots that have been taken from the Butler County election committee that are sitting around," Bugar told CNN. "There's no record or indication that they entered the mail stream. There's paperwork that goes along with it."Build your own road to 270 electoral votes with CNN's interactive mapSheasley, however, said an investigation indicated that many of the ballots that were not received were scheduled to have been mailed around Columbus Day. He said officials were continuing to investigate the matter while taking steps to ensure that no one who requested a ballot and did not receive one is left disenfranchised, including setting up a special email address, a call center and expediting ballots to people in special circumstances."Our focus right now is to make sure that everyone that was impacted by this gets a ballot and is able to vote," Sheasley said.(CNN) - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Friday a new coronavirus stimulus bill should be considered at the beginning of 2021, not in a post-election lame duck session of Congress as some lawmakers had hoped would happen after pre-election talks failed."We probably need to do another package, certainly more modest than the $3 trillion dollar Nancy Pelosi package," McConnell told Hugh Hewitt's radio program. "I think that'll be something we'll need to do right at the beginning of the year."The decision could put off for weeks badly needed aid to hard hit Americans and businesses who have been anxious to see more aid quickly approved and stall its impact on the economy.Talks between the administration and congressional Democrats -- led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- over another stimulus package have floundered for months and members in both parties have expressed hope that getting past the election would remove some of the intense politics that they believe have kept the sides from reaching an agreement. The lack of a deal has left millions of Americans without additional unemployment benefits and money has long run out to aid small businesses, among other entities waiting on money from Washington to respond to the Covid pandemic and its widespread economic fallout.   McConnell's comments signal that he wants to wait even longer before turning again to the issue. The issue of how much to spend on a new bill has deeply divided the Senate Republicans McConnell leads, as GOP lawmakers have balked at proposals that have a nearly $2 trillion price tag. "I think we need to make a careful, calculated decision about what more to do to deal with this Coronavirus. We're throwing money at the search for a vaccine, which is the wise thing to do," McConnell said, adding later, "We could target it particularly at small businesses that are struggling, and hospitals that are now dealing with the second wave of the Coronavirus, and of course the challenges for education, both K-12 and college."A decision to not move a bill in the lame duck is something McConnell as majority leader can control in his chamber until January even if Republicans lose majority control in next week's elections.. A delay could also affect a new president, should former Vice President Joe Biden win the White House, by putting off much-needed economic stimulus and requiring Biden to make it a first order of business for his administration. McConnell made the comment after being asked what his priorities would be next year if Republicans had control of the White House, House and Senate. Pelosi said earlier Friday morning she is "still hopeful" that the Democrats can come to an agreement on the stimulus bill with the Trump administration, though noting there are still large areas of disagreement."So we have a major difference of opinion. I was hoping that we could reconcile them. I still am hopeful that we will," Pelosi told MSNBC.Pelosi's comment came the day after her conflicts with chief White House negotiator, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, spilled into public view. On Thursday afternoon, Mnuchin slammed Pelosi in their highest-profile clash so far, saying the speaker is refusing to compromise to get much-needed aid to Americans."Your ALL OR NONE approach is hurting hard-working Americans who need help NOW," Mnuchin wrote in a letter.His remarks came after Pelosi sent her own letter to Mnuchin earlier Thursday that emphasized just how divided the two sides remain on the details of a potential stimulus bill and hit the Trump administration for not accepting Democratic demands on key issues including funding for state and local governments, school safety provisions, childcare and unemployment insurance.(CNN) - The Senate majority is firmly within Democrats' reach with just a week to go until Election Day. That wasn't necessarily expected a year ago, but Democrats' improving fortunes have a lot do with President Donald Trump. Republicans breathed a sigh of relief after the second presidential debate last week, where they think the President at least didn't hurt himself. But Trump has been a consistent drag on down-ballot Republicans, and he's spurred Democrats to raise staggering sums of money. Democrats in once-red suburban House districts started shattering fundraising records in the 2018 midterms, and now a similar dynamic is playing out across the Senate landscape, with Democratic challengers raising more in one quarter than incumbents and challengers -- combined -- used to raise in an entire cycle. And while that money has helped Democrats expand the playing field deeper into Trump states -- like South Carolina, Kansas and Alaska, for example -- it's not going unanswered in the final weeks of the campaign. Senate Leadership Fund, a GOP super PAC tied to Senate leadership, raised nearly $50 million in the first two weeks of October that it can use to level the playing field in red states where the Democratic candidates have had significant fundraising advantages. Conservative donor enthusiasm for the Senate underscores that Republicans think holding the chamber is their best firewall against Democratic-controlled government -- a theme coming through in some GOP advertising in individual races.A lot depends on the presidential race in the final stretch, since down-ballot races have become increasingly nationalized. In 2016, for the first time, every state voted for president the same way it did for Senate. For Senate Democrats looking at Democratic nominee Joe Biden's poll numbers, that's good news. Biden led Trump by 52% to 42% in CNN's Poll of Polls as of Thursday and held margins of varying sizes in several states with key Senate races. Interactive: 2020 Senate race ratingsDemocrats need a net gain of four Senate seats to win the chamber if Biden loses. Assuming Democrats lose Alabama -- which CNN has consistently ranked the seat most likely to flip this year -- they need to flip five other seats. But if Biden wins the presidency, they need a net gain of only three since the vice president breaks ties in the Senate. Again, assuming they lose Alabama, Democrats would need to flip four seats. Colorado and Arizona are top targets, and they've been consistently ranked No. 2 and 3, respectively, in CNN's ranking of seats most likely to flip. The rankings are based on CNN's reporting, as well as polling, fundraising and advertising spending data. There's a handful of GOP-held seats that come next on the ranking that could put Democrats over the edge. Besides Alabama, though, Democrats also have to keep their eye on Michigan -- the only other state Trump won in 2016 where a Democrat is running for reelection. Even with Biden leading there, the Wolverine State rounds out the bottom of this ranking.There are many more Republican trouble spots than Democratic trouble spots, though. Biden is doing better among White working-class voters than Hillary Clinton did in 2016, which is helping him narrow Trump's margin in many red states. That gives Senate Democrats a chance to play offense -- even if Trump is ultimately expected to carry those states. In Kansas, for example, Trump was leading by just 7 points -- down from his 21-point margin in 2016 -- and GOP Rep. Roger Marshall was ahead by only 4 in a New York Times/Siena College poll from last week. Biden's competitiveness in Texas has also given Democrats late optimism about the Senate race there, although it's still a Lean Republican contest, according to Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales, a CNN contributor.Both parties acknowledge something would have to go horribly wrong for Republicans to lose the Senate race in Mississippi. But the spending disparity there is not to be ignored: Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who won a 2018 special election, raised just $84,000 during the first two weeks of October. During the same period, Democratic challenger Mike Espy raised nearly $4 million. The Southern state that's perhaps most concerning to Republicans is Georgia, where Biden is competitive and where not one but both Senate seats are at risk. The special election featuring Sen. Kelly Loeffler is almost certain to go to a runoff. The regular election, featuring GOP Sen. David Perdue, ranks seventh on this list. But if neither candidate gets a majority, which seems likely, it'll also go to a runoff, which means that while Election Day is next week, the fight over the balance of the Senate could extend until January. Here are the seats most likely to flip partisan control:1. AlabamaIncumbent: Democratic Sen. Doug JonesEver since scandal-plagued Roy Moore lost the GOP nomination earlier this year, there hasn't been much that could displace Jones as the most vulnerable senator of the year. Even against Moore, who was facing allegations of sexual assault, the Democrat only barely won a 2017 special election. He's outraising and outspending Republican Tommy Tuberville, and his best path to victory remains turning out Black voters. But that doesn't look like enough to overcome the partisan lean of the state. Trump won Alabama by 28 points, and unlike in some other red states he carried in 2016, where his margins are slipping, he's holding up pretty well in the Yellowhammer State. 2. ColoradoIncumbent: Republican Sen. Cory GardnerThe president Gardner has chosen to put in one of his most recent ads isn't the current occupant of the White House; it's former Democratic President John F. Kennedy. That says a lot about this first-term Republican senator's reelection fight in a state Trump lost by 5 points in 2016 and is likely to lose again this year. Gardner needs ticket-splitters, hence he's touting the bipartisanship of his own work on conservation legislation but he also can't afford to alienate the GOP base. That's a difficult balance to strike, and one that doesn't leave him with much of a path to victory. Democrat John Hickenlooper, meanwhile, has been putting Trump in his ads to tie Gardner to the top of the ticket. The former Democratic governor has faced his own stumbles, but the partisanship of the state during a presidential election year should help him become the next senator from the Centennial State. 3. ArizonaIncumbent: Republican Sen. Martha McSally This is McSally's second bid for Senate in as many years, and some of the dynamics that hurt her in that 2018 race are at play again this year. The former congresswoman, who was appointed to the open seat after losing last time, is still struggling to simultaneously appeal to Trump supporters and the suburban voters -- especially women -- who dislike him. The difference this year is that Trump is on the ballot with her. Depending on how he does in Arizona, that could give McSally a boost. But with Biden having an edge in several recent polls of the state, Trump could also drag her down. She's facing a well-funded opponent in Democrat Mark Kelly, a NASA astronaut and the husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Kelly led McSally 52% to 42% among registered voters in a Monmouth University poll from mid-October, a widening of his 6-point advantage from the same pollster in September. Underscoring McSally's problem: Nearly half of Arizona voters said she had been too supportive of the President -- and that was even higher among independents -- compared with 38% of voters who said she's given him the right amount of support. 4. MaineIncumbent: Republican Sen. Susan CollinsThe four-term senator is in the toughest fight of her career. And while Republicans hope voters in the state's more conservative 2nd District may be coming home to her in the final stretch, she still faces a daunting path to reelection with the state's use of ranked choice voting. She's trying to hold on to ticket-splitting voters (who do still exist in Maine) while not alienating base voters who think she hasn't been chummy enough with Trump. She hasn't made the same commitment she did in 2016 not to vote for him. But there's no love lost between Collins and the President, who tweeted earlier this month that she's "not worth the work." Democrats, however, are trying to nationalize the contest, eagerly pointing out all the times she's voted with Trump, with Democrat Sara Gideon arguing this race is just as much about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's fate as leader as it is about Collins. The senator may earn plaudits for being the only Republican to vote against Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court nomination, citing the closeness to the election and the precedent set in 2016, but that probably won't win her back voters who were enraged by her support of Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018. 5. North CarolinaIncumbent: Republican Sen. Thom TillisRepublicans think they caught a break in North Carolina with Democrat Cal Cunningham's sex scandal, especially if it gives conservatives a reason to vote for Tillis, who has long struggled to consolidate the Republican vote. Senate Leadership Fund has seized on the issue to argue the Army reservist is a hypocrite who lacks the character he's campaigned on. Cunningham has now responded in his own spot saying, "Tillis is desperately attacking my personal life because he doesn't want to talk about his own record." He goes on to tell voters, "It may be my name on the ballot, but it's your health care." Public polling, at least, seems to bear out Cunningham's bet that voters don't much care about his personal scandal. He led Tillis by 49% to 43% among likely voters in a CBS/YouGov poll released Sunday, with nearly an equal percentage of likely voters saying they disapprove of how each candidate handles himself personally. A Washington Post/ABC News poll from mid-October showed no clear leader, but 71% of registered voters said Cunningham's affair was less important, while 81% said who controls the Senate was more important to them. Carrying that message, however, requires spending, and Cunningham entered the final stretch of the race with a cash-on-hand deficit. But in one of the states most saturated with political advertising, the Senate race may come down to what happens in the presidential contest, which has been consistently close here.6. IowaIncumbent: Republican Sen. Joni ErnstBoth sides acknowledge this race is a coin toss. Trump carried the state by nearly 10 points in 2016. But now Ernst -- the first woman elected to federal office in Iowa -- is in the same boat as many GOP senators who need to convince voters why they deserve a second term, even if Trump doesn't. A recent spot from the National Republican Senatorial Committee makes a checks and balances argument for rejecting Democrat Theresa Greenfield, implying that Senate control would be the last defense against a President Biden and Democratic House. Ernst burst onto the political scene with her infamous 2014 "make 'em squeal" ad, but she may not have done herself any favors in a recent debate, where she couldn't state the price of soybeans. It's not clear the moment has resonated beyond the headlines, but Republicans are worried that Greenfield -- who talks about being a "farm kid" -- has had a fundraising advantage. (She raised nearly four times as much as Ernst in the first two weeks of October.) A recent New York Times/Siena College poll had Ernst at 45% to Greenfield's 44% and Biden at 46% to Trump's 43% among likely voters -- all within the margin of error. Monmouth's poll from around the same time showed an essentially tied Senate race, as it has for much of the late summer and fall. 7. GeorgiaIncumbent: Republican Sen. David PerdueBiden's trip to Georgia on Tuesday says it all -- the state is in play, and that's making Republicans nervous about holding on to both Senate seats, most immediately Perdue's. The Atlanta suburbs are changing fast, and they're populated with the kinds of well-educated and diverse voters who don't like the President. Perdue has been outraised by Democrat Jon Ossoff, who lost the most expensive House race in history in 2017, and the GOP incumbent is still responding to Democratic attacks about his stock trades. Senate Leadership Fund aired an ad defending Perdue on the issue, an unusual and telling move since super PACs often stick to attacking opponents. A CBS/YouGov poll released Sunday had the race even, with Perdue at 47% to Ossoff's 46% among likely voters, while a Quinnipiac University poll from earlier in the month gave Ossoff a 51% to 45% edge. Getting more than 50% on Election Day is Ossoff's best path to victory. If neither candidate receives a majority, the contest advances to a January runoff, when Democrats might not have the same level of enthusiasm (and the spending) of a presidential race.8. MontanaIncumbent: Republican Sen. Steve DainesAnother first-term Republican, Daines is facing two-term Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock, who's proved he can win statewide at the same time Trump carries the state. The President isn't expected to post anywhere near the 21-point margin he did in 2016 (a recent New York Times/Siena College poll gave him just a 6-point lead among likely voters). Which is why, in addition to attacking Bullock as being too liberal, Republicans have turned to a checks and balances argument here: "Imagine Biden, Pelosi and Schumer in charge -- it could happen if Steve Bullock is elected to the Senate," a recent National Republican Senatorial Committee ad says. Montanans are used to splitting their tickets, as Bullock's 2016 reelection, and Democratic Sen. Jon Tester's reelection two years later, showed. Since then, though, Bullock has run for president against Trump. And Republicans hope that with Trump on the ticket, the partisanship of Montana will be too much for Bullock to overcome. The New York Times survey had Daines at 49% and Bullock at 46%, within the margin of error. 9. South CarolinaIncumbent: Republican Sen. Lindsey GrahamIf there's any Senate race where the Supreme Court vacancy has altered the trajectory, it may be South Carolina, where Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham's visibility during Barrett's confirmation hearings gave him a prominent platform to raise money. Republican outside groups have also come to his rescue, with Senate Leadership Fund spending nearly $16 million in the state. Despite Democrat Jaime Harrison raising a record-breaking $57 million in the third quarter, he may be outspent in the final stretch. Republicans hope that Graham's Judiciary Committee performance will also help him consolidate support among conservatives, who've long viewed him skeptically. Democrats are trying to exploit any lingering gap there, though, with Senate Majority PAC running ads about how Graham has criticized Trump while Harrison props up a third-party candidate as the true conservative. Bill Bledsoe already dropped out and endorsed Graham, but his name is still on the ballot. A New York Times/Siena College poll taken in mid-October (with the final days of interviews overlapping with the confirmation hearings) gave Graham a 6-point lead and Trump an 8-point lead. Democrats will also be closely watching the turnout of Black voters -- a crucial voting bloc to get Harrison across the finish line. 10. MichiganIncumbent: Democratic Sen. Gary PetersSome recent public polling has shown a close race here. A New York Times/Siena College poll from early October, for example, put Peters ahead by just 43% to 42%, well within the margin of error. Republicans think that reflects the strength of their candidate, Iraq War veteran John James, compared with the first-term incumbent. But Democrats aren't buying it, pointing out that Peters outraised James in the pre-general reporting period -- a change from earlier in the year --  and that Biden's edge here should boost the incumbent. A Fox News poll from later in October gave Peters a 49% to 41% lead among likely voters, which is more in line with what one would expect if the Democrats are performing well here at the top of the ticket. Still, given the outside spending from both sides in the Senate race, this contest is worth keeping a close eye on. (CNN) - Although our universe is full of wonders, it's equally riddled with horrors. Colorful posters styled like vintage horror movie adverts highlight some of these cosmic frights in the latest release from NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The posters are free to download from NASA's site, and they're also available in Spanish. Released just in time for Halloween, the posters shed light on dangers and mysteries across the universe. The agency has also released a SoundCloud playlist that includes the scary sounds of space.Previous posters have highlighted the wonders of our own solar system as well as potentially habitable exoplanets, or planets outside of our solar system, where they imagine how humans might one day visit these faraway places. But the phenomena illustrated in these posters are a little more sinister. The posters combine imaginative artistic renderings with intriguing science. Teams of artists and scientists have been collaborating on them since 2014.The latest additions to NASA's Galaxy of Horrors poster collection include elusive dark matter, a deadly gamma ray burst and a "galactic graveyard."The galactic graveyard poster showcases an old galaxy where star birth suddenly halted just a few billion years after the big bang. Now, it's a graveyard of decaying stars and the only stars that remain are small and red, which cast an eerie red glow. "Dare to enter, and you might encounter the frightening corpses of exoplanets or the final death throes of once-mighty stars," reads the JPL caption. The "Gamma Ray Ghouls" poster shows what happens when dead stars collide: a gamma ray burst. This is one of the most powerful explosions in the universe. "These beams of doom are unleashed upon their unfortunate surroundings, shining a million trillion times brighter than the Sun for up to 30 terrifying seconds. No spaceship will shield you from the blinding destruction of the gamma ray ghouls!" says the text on this poster. And then there is dark matter. This invisible gravity provides structure for the universe, but scientists don't know what it's made of and have tried to detect a dark matter "particle" for years. "One of the things I really like about these posters is that if you spend some time studying the art and then maybe go learn a little more about each of these topics, you'll see there was a lot of thought by the artists about the choices they made to highlight the science," said Jason Rhodes, an astrophysicist at JPL who consulted on the project, in a statement.For example, the spiderweb used in the dark matter poster is a clever allusion to the cosmic web structure of the universe, which connects galaxies together, that we can't see. The gamma ray poster also highlights the danger of being caught close to the collision between dead stars and the energy they would unleash. Judy Racusin, an astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center who also consulted on the posters, highlighted how rare gamma ray bursts are -- so they aren't likely to impact Earth.A gamma ray burst goes off in our galaxy only about once every 10,000 years, but they are visible to us only about every 10 million to 100 million years, according to NASA."The poster art is a really fun way to imagine one of these happening," Racusin said. "But I wouldn't want to be those space travelers!"  (CNN) - LeAnn Rimes has opened up about her struggle with psoriasis, sharing two "unabashedly honest" photographs of her skin on Instagram.The 38-year-old country star shared the photos on Thursday to mark World Psoriasis Day. She revealed her battle with the condition, which causes skin to become red, flaky, sore and itchy, in an essay for Glamour magazine."You know when you say something you've been holding in for so long, and it's such a sigh of relief? That's what these photos are to me. I needed this. My whole bodymy mind, my spiritneeded this desperately," she wrote in her Instagram post."Music has been my gift, and why I'm here. But I want to give a voice to these other pieces of me. And I want to give a voice to what so many other people are going through. This is finally my time to be unabashedly honest about what psoriasis is and what it looks like," she wrote.Glamour shared a naked image of Rimes on Instagram, which shows her psoriasis.Fans called the singer courageous and brave for sharing her story, saying it made them feel less alone in facing their own challenges. Rimes, who has also been open about her struggle with depression, and her interest in spirituality and meditation, published an Instagram story thanking people for the "overwhelming outpouring of love" she had received.'Know you are not alone'"It's been quite an activating day, I have to say, to sit in all of this and to allow myself to be seen so deeply. I know there's so many out there who relate to this, and relate to me -- and I relate to you and everything that you're going through," she said."Just know that. Know that you're not alone. That was my main reason for wanting to share so vulnerably, as I know so many people are struggling and do struggle with psoriasis amongst many, many other things," she said."I wanted to share in our humanness. So just know that you are loved, and you are worthy, as I tell myself the same thing over and over again. Just thank you for the love."Rimes has been sharing guided meditation throughout the coronavirus pandemic. She also wrote a new song, titled "There Will Be A Better Day," which she shared on Instagram in March.(CNN) - October has not one, but two full moons -- and because it's 2020, the second one naturally falls on Halloween. That gives this year 13 full moons instead of the usual 12.And if you spot what looks like a fiery red star near the full moon, that's Mars. The red planet made its closest approach to Earth earlier in October, and it's still shining bright in the night sky. October's first full moon was the harvest moon on October 1, and the second is a rare full Halloween blue hunter's moon. While the moon won't actually look blue, the second full moon in one month is usually referred to as a blue moon. This happens every 2.5 to three years, or "once in a blue moon."Previously, a blue moon was known as the third or fourth full moon in a single season.Typically, the next moon after the harvest moon is known as the hunter's moon -- when hunters used moonlight to hunt prey and prepare for winter. While a blue moon seems rare, a full moon on Halloween across time zones is even more rare -- an event that hasn't occurred since 1944. However, a full moon occurs on Halloween every 19 years in some time zones, so you can expect a full Halloween moon again in 2039, 2058, 2077 and 2096. The full Halloween moon will rise at 10:49 am ET on October 31, which explains why the moon will be visible across time zones. If you aren't able to see it due to bad weather or cloud cover in your area, the Virtual Telescope Project will share a live stream of the Halloween blue moon rising above Rome.This is also the last day of Daylight Saving Time for many people around the world, so set your clocks back an hour on November 1 at 2 am. (The clocks already went back one hour across Europe on October 25 at 2 a.m.) We get it; this is a weird weekend. This has been the year of the pandemic, there's a full moon on Halloween and the time changes the next day -- and Tuesday is the US Election Day. Each month of 2020 has brought its own surprises, which have been comparable to a veritable Jumanji game of "well, I didn't see that coming."To help you keep calm and carry on, we suggest stargazing. Look up this weekend to see the full moon and Mars and revel in the wonders of the night sky. (CNN) - The European Union has earmarked 220 million euros ($257 million) to fund the transfer of Covid-19 patients across its borders to prevent the hospital systems in the 27-nation bloc from buckling.Europe has become the world's epicenter of the virus for the second time since the pandemic began, forcing several countries to reimpose national lockdowns as a second wave envelops the region and infection cases surpass 10 million. Health officials in several EU countries have warned that their hospitals are near capacity and have raised the alarm that more cooperation is needed to ensure facilities are not overwhelmed."Numbers of cases are rising, numbers of hospitalizations are rising, numbers of deaths are rising --  not as fast, fortunately, because we understand better today how to treat COVID patients and how to deal with disease," EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said Thursday night."But the spread of the virus will overwhelm our healthcare systems if we do not act urgently."Von der Leyen made her comments at a meeting with EU leaders, in which she laid out a number of measures to streamline and centralize the bloc's Covid-19 response, from the use of tests, tracing apps and the distribution of vaccines. The EU was slow to coordinate its response at the beginning of the region's outbreak, with hard-hit countries like Italy pleading with the bloc's leaders for support, turning instead to China for medical equipment. (CNN) - The El Paso County Judge has ordered a two-week shutdown of non-essential services due to new Covid-19 cases soaring in the Texas community. "Since the inception of this pandemic, El Paso County has never seen this level of infections through our community," Judge Ricardo Samaniego, who acts as the county's chief administrator, said during a virtual news conference Thursday.Samaniego made the decision based on the advice of medical professionals and hospital administrators, he said. As of Thursday evening, according to Samaniego, the hospitalization rate was 44%, a 365.2% increase from the beginning of the month. The order went into effect at midnight on Thursday night."Our hospitals, our capacity, our medical professionals are overwhelmed, and if we don't respond, we will see unprecedented levels of death." Election activities are considered essential services, Samaniego said, and will not be affected. He assured residents that steps have been taken to assure polling places are safe. Other essential services, like grocery stores, pharmacies and schools that provide meal service can remain open. But businesses like tattoo parlors, hair and nail salons and gyms must close for two weeks. Restaurants will be limited to delivery or curbside service.As of Friday morning, El Paso County, which sits on the southern border with Mexico, had reported 1,347 new positive Covid-19 tests and 10 new deaths, bringing the total death toll to 595, according to the City/County of El Paso Covid-19 website. There were more than 15,000 active cases in the community. The shutdown will be aimed at relieving the "strain on our medical resources." The Judge said he recognized the financial impact the shutdown could have on El Paso residents, and said he was committed to finding ways to assist in the recovery. AG 'exploring all legal actions'El Paso Mayor Dee Margo said he was seeking clarification on the order from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's office. "The Judge did not consult me and refuses to return my call, so I am seeking clarification from the Attorney General on the new County order, which does not supersede the Governor's orders," said Mayor Dee Margo in a statement released Thursday night. "What I can speak to is the hurt our community is going through," the mayor added. "We must strike a balance of keeping our neighbors safe while not destroying people's abilities to feed their families." But Paxton said the county judge "has no authority to shut down business in El Paso County," calling it a "direct violation" of an order from Gov. Greg Abbott. "My office is quickly exploring all legal actions," Paxton said on Twitter. Samaniego said he had spoken with Abbott, but the discussion was "not fruitful.""I'm also very cognizant and respectful of the governor's orders," Samaniego said. "The hard truth is that the people who are dying are El Pasoans; they are not in Austin."Samaniego previously issued a nightly curfew for two weeks beginning Sunday night from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., citing infection rates and hospitalizations. He said then the curfew was instituted instead of a stay-at-home order because officials wanted to minimize the economic impact on businesses and families. At that time, Mayor Margo said an analysis of new cases between October 6 and October 20 in the community showed that 37% of infections were from visits to big-box stores, 22.5% came from restaurants and 19% were due to travel to Mexico. Parties, gyms and large gatherings also contributed to new cases, to lesser degrees. (CNN) - A 2018 wildfire that killed three people and destroyed more than 1,600 structures in Southern California was sparked by utility equipment in fierce winds, according to a redacted investigative report determining the origin of the fire.The report was released this week after Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge William Highberger said a delay caused by a California attorney general's office investigation no longer outweighed the public's right to know the cause of the fire. "The Investigation Team (IT) determined electrical equipment associated with the Big Rock 16kV circuit, owned and operated by Southern California Edison (SCE), was the cause of the Woolsey Fire," the report stated. Under strong winds, a guy wire on a steel pole connected with an energized conductor, causing "heated material" to fall on vegetation "thereby causing the Woolsey Fire," it states.A "communication line" that was hooked up to the steel pole also was energized and a second fire was reported about a quarter of a mile away underneath the communication line, the report states. The two fires merged to become the Woolsey fire, the report says.However, five full pages and several sentences in the conclusory remarks remain redacted. The 70-page report includes the redacted pages under a section called "Violations."The fast-moving Woolsey Fire burned 96,949 acres in Ventura and Los Angeles counties in November 2018, destroying 1,634 structures and causing three deaths. It became one of the most destructive fires in the state, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire. A burn scar from the fire was captured by NASA's Terra satellite.Southern California Edison said in 2019 that its equipment was "likely" the cause of the fire, which began at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory in Simi Valley."Absent additional evidence, SCE believes it is likely that its equipment was associated with the ignition of the Woolsey Fire," the company said. The company said it did not find evidence of downed electrical wires at the suspected origin point of the fire, but it did report an outage on its electrical system near that point and found a pole support wire close to an electrical wire that was energized before that reported outage.A witness reported seeing fire near the equipment around that time, the company said. The report also cited multiple witnesses who reported hearing a loud buzzing noise or experiencing a power outage before seeing smoke and fire in the area. The news of the investigative report was first reported by the Ventura County Star newspaper.In a statement given to the Star on Wednesday, Edison spokesman Chris Abel said the company fully cooperated with investigators and "shared the conclusion of Ventura County Fire Department's redacted Woolsey report." Abel did not respond to a CNN request for comment. A Cal Fire spokesperson directed requests for comment to the Los Angeles Superior Court, which did not immediately respond.Power line may have started current fireA Southern California Edison power line may have played a role in the ignition of the ongoing Silverado Fire, a report filed recently with California Public Utilities Commission shows.The initial safety incident report describes overhead electrical facilities in the origin area of the Silverado Fire, but notes there was no activity on the circuit."We reported the incident despite seeing no activity on the nearby 12-kV circuit nor any downed power lines because it appears that a lashing wire attached to a telecommunications line may have contacted SCE's power line above it, possibly starting the fire," Abel told CNN earlier this week.The fire began in a place considered to be a "high fire risk area," and will be investigated by the Orange County Fire Authority. The company promised to cooperate fully with that investigation. "Our top priority is the safety of customers, employees and communities, which is why we continue to enhance our wildfire mitigation efforts through grid hardening, situational awareness and enhanced operational practices," Abel said.Federal investigators looking into the origins of the Bobcat Fire are focusing on utility equipment owned by Southern California Edison that experienced an issue moments before the fire was first reported.The fire, one of the largest wildfires in Los Angeles County history, started on September 6 and charred at least 115,000 acres.Edison spokesman David Song told CNN last month that the utility received a request from US Forest Service officials on September 15 to turn over a section of SCE's overhead conductor near Cogswell Dam. That's the area where the Bobcat Fire was sparked. (CNN) - The Iranian hackers suspected of posing as the Proud Boys and sending threatening emails to potentially thousands of American voters accessed voter registration data in at least one state, US federal officials said Friday evening. The hackers had posted a video online last week that purported to show they had access to information about American voters. The FBI and the government's cybersecurity agency, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said Friday that the Iranians had "obtained voter registration data in at least one state.""A review of the records that were copied and obtained reveals the information was used in the propaganda videos," the agencies said in a joint advisory. Some threatening emails that were sent last week to voters in multiple states, including Florida and Alaska, read, "You will vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you." The emails were made to look as if they had been sent by the Proud Boys, a hate group embraced by President Donald Trump at the first debate, but were actually the work of Iranian hackers, US intelligence and law enforcement agencies announced last week. Some of the emails included the home addresses of the voters the messages were sent to. The Iranian government last week denied it was interfering in the US election. "Unlike the U.S., Iran does not interfere in other country's elections. The world has been witnessing U.S.' own desperate public attempts to question the outcome of its own election at the highest level," Alireza Miryousefi, the press officer for Iran's mission to the UN, wrote on Twitter.(CNN) - As the United States approaches 9 million Covid-19 cases, the country keeps racking up infection rates and other statistics that alarm experts.FOLLOW THE LATEST UPDATESOn Thursday, the country reported a record-setting 88,521 new cases and reported 971 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.  Here are a few more startling numbers from the week that saw 536,131 new cases, as reported by Johns Hopkins.      The US average of new cases per day is 76,590.
      That's up 25% from the previous week.
      It's an 83% increase over the last month.
      Nine states reported a record high single-day of new cases Thursday: Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota and Ohio.Thirty states which have reported a record high: Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

The inaugural game will feature video tributes and interviews with descendants and survivors of the attack that leveled the historic Freedmen's town of Greenwood, Oklahoma. The game will be an annual tradition on the second home football game for the university. "I thought it was crazy that I never knew about it, that I was never taught about it," Fletcher tells CNN. "That was shocking, to say the least. And when I learned about it -- when I first got here. It changed my life." The Texas native, who was raised in Austin, and began coaching at TU five years ago hopes that Friday's game will break the cycle of excluding the legacy of Black Wall Street from history.Like many generations of American students, he says he wasn't taught about the Tulsa Massacre in school. Many records were destroyed, suppressed and deliberately excluded from the curriculum."I came up during the time that was right off the heels of segregation," Fletcher, 43, reflects. And while he says he knew a lot about history, he didn't know much about the history in the neighboring state of Oklahoma.Fletcher received an informal education on the massacre from fellow Black Tulsa residents and it even came up during conversations at a local barbershop."It blew my mind because I didn't know bombs were dropped. I've known and read in different parts of history where people were hung or burned and stuff like that. But it never occurred to me that anything was bombed by plane," he says. "And that's when I knew this was totally different than any other situation and for people to not have talked about it was alarming to me. And it was just saddening."What happened in Tulsa in 1921Tulsa was once home to one of the most prosperous African American communities in the country. Dubbed Black Wall Street, Greenwood was originally founded as a Freedmen's colony of emancipated slaves and became a home to thriving schools and businesses. Native Americans and Black residents became wealthy after the discovery of oil in the early 1900s on what had previously been seen as worthless land.Neighboring White Tulsans had longstanding issues with the self-sufficient Black town, and violence sparked after allegations that a Black man had assaulted a White elevator operator. While Black residents rushed to the Tulsa County Courthouse to prevent a lynching, White residents were deputized and handed weapons. Over the next 12 hours, the city of Greenwood experienced an all out assault fraught with arson, shootings, and aerial bombings from private planes. By the morning of June 1, 1921, Greenwood had been burned to the ground.Death toll estimates have fluctuated over the years, but as many as 300 people were killed, and nearly 6,000 Black residents were interned in nearby facilities until it was safe to pick up the remains of their previous lives and start over.  Today, eyewitness accounts of the racial massacre are housed among the collections of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture. Coffins found in mass graves have been excavated as part of the modern-day study on the American massacre. Two TU Graduate students even started the #TulsaSyllabus project to serve as a  resource for researchers, activists, educators, the press, and general public to gain a better understanding of how race and racism manifest in Tulsa, Oklahoma.What activism looks like The strides being made today may not erase the damage done to Greenwood or the collective traumas of Black Americans, but Fletcher and others like him hope these efforts help atone for a tragic history. By establishing the annual 'Legacy of Black Wall Street' game, Fletcher wants to demonstrate to his players how to build social action using the resources available to them. His activism shows his players as well as his own children that coaching does not strictly limit his influence to the 100 yard field. It is also about influencing others to be conscious, contributing members of their community. "Under that hat of coach there is counselor, there's brother, there's father, there's mentor, there's advocate, there's facilitator. If you want our young people, men and women alike, to be successful you have to start communication."(CNN) - Other: A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter.

We social distance. We do all of the things that you have to do.""If you get close, wear a mask. 'Oh, it's controversial.' It's not controversial to me. You get close, you wear a mask. Social distance, social distance," he told the audience.Problem: Vazquez notes the audience Trump delivered this message to was largely maskless. They were packed so tightly that several people required medical attention due to the heat and a nearby fire truck had to cool supporters down. Staff was also seen without masks.How Trump's favorite doctor helped influence Florida -- It's not news that infectious disease experts have been replaced at Trump's side by Scott Atlas, the Stanford neuroradiologist (not infectious disease doctor) who the President saw and liked on Fox News.But this report from CNN's John Avlon and Michael Warren shows how Atlas's guidance, which runs counter to orthodoxy, has gone from Fox, to the White House, and then filtered out to states with Trump-supporting governors, like Florida."Excess death" data may reveal Covid's true death toll -- CNN has tracked more than 228,000 deaths attributed to Covid. But recent CDC data suggests a much higher rate of "excess deaths" in the US from January through October. In addition to direct Covid deaths, 100,000 more Americans died than would normally. A group of senators has asked CDC and HHS to explain how they're addressing the spike.Unintended consequences -- We're into the portion of this election where local events can influence national elections. Keep an eye on weather, Covid spikes, and racial unrest.Will unrest in Philadelphia affect the election? It seems right now like the swingiest swing state of 2020. Trump needs at least one Rust Belt state that defected from Democrats in 2016 to stay with him in 2020 and he's within striking distance in Pennsylvania.Now, the killing of Walter Wallace, a Black man suffering from mental health issues who was advancing on police with a knife has the state's largest urban center and Democratic stronghold on edge. Protests have devolved to looting. Trump has maintained his criticism of cities led by Democrats while former Vice President Joe Biden has tried to balance outrage at the killing of a Black man by police with disapproval of looting.

There are a number of prediction models out thee -- from FiveThirtyEight and The Economist, among others -- that suggest Biden is much more likely to win than Trump. CNN's Oliver Darcy talked to the data journalists behind them to ask why they're any better than they were in 2016, when they also said a Trump loss was more likely (although less likely than now). Here's Nate Silver to Darcy on this year's modeling: "We're not going out on any sort of limb here. We're just stating the obvious.

CNN uses House and Senate ratings from Inside Elections, which is run by CNN contributor Nathan L. Gonzalez.What's changed: According to CNN's report, Democrats are now predicted to pick up a net gain of 14 to 20 seats in the House, and a net gain of four to six seats in the Senate, which would be enough to flip the chamber. Key details: Two US Senate races in Georgia are becoming more difficult for Republicans, but both could end up in a December runoff.More suburban House seats are tilting away from Republicans and toward Democrats.Cringeworthy moments:Sen. Kelly Loeffler, the Republican running for election to the seat she was appointed to, claimed to reporters she was unaware of the infamous Trump Access Hollywood tape. So CNN's Manu Raju explained it to her.  Sen. Susan Collins, a rare moderate Republican, struggled to answer a question about systemic bias in Maine, a mostly White state, but which has a large Somali community.Sen. Martha McSally, the Republican who lot a race in Arizona in '16 and is now running for election to the seat she was later appointed to, was rushed onstage by Trump during a rally and given a minute to speak because, he told her in front of everyone, "they don't want to hear this."		: Things are getting more interesting in battleground statesAdam Levy from CNN's political unit has been closely tracking the early vote in key states -- with information CNN gets from the firm Catalist, a data firm which has Democrats, issue organizations and academics as clients. Read the full story.Key point: Republicans are beginning to narrow the Democratic advantage in pre-Election Day voting in four key battleground states, where more than 12 million votes have already been cast.Florida -- Trump won by 1+ point in 2016      A week ago Democrats had a 9 percentage point lead in ballots cast. Now it is 4 percentage points.North Carolina - Trump won by more than 3+ points in '16      Democrats had a 12-point advantage over Republican ballots cast last week. Now it's 8 points.Iowa - Trump won by 9+ points in '16      Democrats have a 17-point lead over Republicans in pre-election vote, but that lead has narrowed by four points this week. Democrats also held a lead in pre-election vote in 2016.Nevada - Clinton won by 2-points in '16      Last week, Democrats led Republicans by 12 points. Now, the 42% of ballots cast by Democrats is now only seven points higher than Republicans' 35%.Key thing to remember: Republicans have indicated they are more likely to vote on Election Day, so there's an asterisk for this data. We don't know what will happen next week.CORRECTION: This story has been corrected to accurately reflect Atlas' medical specialty.(CNN) - As much of the world struggles to contain new waves of the Covid-19 pandemic, Taiwan just marked its 200th consecutive day without a locally transmitted case of the disease.Taipei's response to the coronavirus pandemic has been one of the world's most effective. The island of 23 million people last reported a locally transmitted case on April 12, which was Easter Sunday. As of Thursday, it had confirmed 553 cases -- only 55 of which were local transmissions. Seven deaths have been recorded. Easter was an important milestone in the United States because President Donald Trump had said a month earlier he wanted the country "opened up and just raring to go" by the holiday.At that point, 1.7 million people had been infected and 110,000 had been killed by the virus -- globally. On Friday, those figures had passed 45 million cases and more than 1.1 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.  Taiwan's landmark achievement comes in a week when France and Germany are enacting new lockdowns and the United States identified a record 88,000-plus cases in a day. The state of Florida, which has a similar population size to Taiwan, with approximately 21 million people, identified 4,188 cases on Wednesday alone. Taiwan has never had to enact strict lockdowns. Nor did it resort to drastic restrictions on civil freedoms, like in mainland China.   Instead, Taiwan's response focused on speed. Taiwanese authorities began screening passengers on direct flights from Wuhan, where the virus was first identified, on December 31, 2019 -- back when the virus was mostly the subject of rumors and limited reporting. Taiwan confirmed its first reported case of the novel coronavirus on January 21 and then banned Wuhan residents from traveling to the island. All passengers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao were required to undergo screening. All this happened before Wuhan itself went into lockdown on January 23. By March, Taiwan banned all foreign nationals from entering the island, apart from diplomats, residents and those with special entry visas.But Taiwan has advantages its counterparts in the West do not. One is geography -- Taiwan is an island, so it's easier for officials to control entry and exit through its borders.  Taiwan also had experience on its side. After suffering through the deadly outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, Taiwan worked to build up its capacity to deal with a pandemic, Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said in an interview last month."So, when we heard that there were some secret pneumonia cases in China where patients were treated in isolation, we knew it was something similar," he said. Authorities activated the island's Central Epidemic Command Center, which was set up in the wake of SARS, to coordinate between different ministries. The government also ramped up face mask and protective equipment production to make sure there would be a steady supply of PPE.The government also invested in mass testing and quick and effective contact tracing. Former Taiwanese Vice President Chen Chien-jen, who is an epidemiologist by training, said lockdowns are not ideal. Chen also said that the type of mass-testing schemes undertaken in mainland China, where millions of people are screened when a handful of cases are detected, are also unnecessary."Very careful contact tracing, and very stringent quarantines of close contacts are the best way to contain Covid-19," he said.(CNN) - Former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump are moving their battle to the critical region of the Midwest on the final Friday before the election, crossing paths in Wisconsin and Minnesota as Biden moves to expand the electoral map by wooing the blue-collar voters who flocked to Trump in 2016.Trump touched down for his first stop in Waterford Township, Michigan, Friday, tossing red "Make America Great Again" hats to the crowd, hours after the US passed a daily record with more than 88,000 new coronavirus cases Thursday. As he continued to downplay the fall surge, Trump complained that restrictions in Minnesota would curtail his plans for his final rally of the day in Rochester, Minnesota, where Democratic state officials, adhering to state Department of Health rules, have insisted that his crowd must be limited to 250 people."We're having a problem with some people in Minnesota," the President told reporters as he left the White House Friday morning, with the campaign blaming "the free-speech stifling dictates" that won't allow the 25,000 people Trump claims want to attend. Republicans got a win in Minnesota Thursday night when a federal appeals court ruled that mailed-in ballots in the state must be received by elections officials no later than Election Day. While there has not been as much polling on Minnesota, the Washington Post/ABC News poll last month showed Trump down by double digits.The two candidates are crisscrossing in the Midwest Friday at a time when Biden is trying to shore up his leads in those states and strengthen his connection to the working class voters that Hillary Clinton neglected in the waning days of her race with Trump four years ago. The former vice president is spending ample time in states that Trump won in 2016, as his team contemplates multiple paths to the 270 electoral votes he needs to win, while Democrats are poised to gain seats in the House and Senate. Though polls show Trump trailing nationally, the Trump team is confident they can win with explosive turn out on Election Day and a superior ground game. If Biden is not able to flip battlegrounds that Trump won like Florida, North Carolina and Georgia, he could potentially carve a path to the White House by rebuilding the Democrats' blue wall in the Rust Belt and capturing Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, while holding Minnesota in the Democratic column.Trump won those three Midwestern states by less than a percentage point in 2016, and Biden's kinship with the blue collar voters who live in working class towns like Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he lived as a young boy, was one of the major selling points to Democratic primary voters as he cultivated the image of "middle-class Joe."While Trump has campaigned, both in 2016 and 2020, as a voice for the "forgotten men and women" who live in those communities, Biden has argued that the President ignored their needs while helping his wealthy allies -- attempting to frame the race as Scranton versus Park Avenue. But Trump has argued that Biden favored trade policies that sent jobs overseas and threw open the border to the detriment of working-class voters.Biden has succeeded in cutting into Trump's margins with White voters who do not hold a college degree -- a trend he hopes to accelerate in the closing days of the campaign as he visits Midwestern states that include Iowa, Michigan and Wisconsin. But Trump rejected Biden's efforts on Friday as he insisted that the Democrat has no enthusiasm at his campaign events and told Michiganders, misleadingly, that "we're still rounding the corner" when it comes to coronavirus. "Four days from now we are going to win this state and we are going on to win four more years in the White House," Trump said in Michigan. "It's going to be a victory like no other."Trump touted positive economic numbers this week, promising that he would continue to create "jobs, jobs, jobs" after Election Day. In Waterford Township, Trump criticized Biden for supporting the North American Free Trade Agreement when it was approved in 1993, arguing that Biden has demonstrated with his record on trade that he doesn't care for "working people." He touted his own efforts to renegotiate with America's trading partners, which resulted in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement."At every turn Biden twisted the knife into the back of Michigan workers and workers all over this country," Trump said. "In 2016 Michigan voted to fire this corrupt political establishment and you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first." Responding to Trump in a statement, Biden said Michigan has been "crushed by the President's failed leadership," pointing to a drop in manufacturing jobs and the fact that unemployment has more than doubled since February.Campaigning in Iowa on Friday, Biden called out what he said were GOP voter suppression efforts and asked his supporters not to be dissuaded from turning out at the polls. "This President has done everything to try to discourage us, to try to convince us that it doesn't  matter," Biden said in Des Moines, noting the President's inaccurate claims that there is widespread voter fraud. "But guess what, he will not be able to stop us at all. ... We will not be silenced," he said, noting the more than 80 million people who have already voted. "Please keep your sense of empowerment; keep your sense of optimism of what we can do together," Biden said, noting the difficulties of keeping up a positive attitude at a time when the nation has hit the tragic milestone of 9 million coronavirus cases and nearly 230,000 US deaths. CNN's Road to 270 interactive mapBattle for FloridaA day earlier, Biden had tried to broadcast that same message about the importance of turnout in Florida, a state prized for its 29 electoral votes and its role as a national barometer. The two candidates went head to head there Thursday as polls showed them locked in a tight race. Trump's path to reelection will be very difficult, though not impossible, without a win in the Sunshine State. During the final week of ad spending, the joint effort of Biden and the Democratic National Committee is spending more in Florida than any other state ($8.6 million). On the other side of the ledger, Trump and the Republican National Committee are spending more in Michigan ($7.2 million) than any other state.Biden has maintained a strong fundraising advantage over Trump in the final months of the campaign, and the Democratic effort is on track to outpace the GOP spending effort by nearly $20 million in the final week, according to an analysis of CMAG/Kantar Media data by CNN's David Wright.Underscoring the importance of the state, Biden's visit to Florida Thursday was preceded by events in recent days featuring former President Barack Obama, who won the state twice. And vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris will campaign Saturday in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties to try to get voters out to the polls on the final weekend of early voting.At a time when millions of voters have already cast their ballots in Florida, the Biden campaign dispatched the former vice president to stoke turnout in the reliable Democratic stronghold of Broward County, then rally voters with a bullhorn at a voter activation center in Fort Lauderdale, finishing the day in the critical swing corridor of Tampa, where the President had stopped just hours before.At the socially distant drive-in rally in South Florida's Broward County -- where Biden thanked attendees for wearing masks and staying six feet apart -- the former vice president called on Floridians to change the course of the pandemic and choose "science over fiction," by using their state to block Trump's path to reelection. "The heart and soul of this country's at stake right in Florida. It's up to you. You hold the key," Biden told a diverse group of voters. "If Florida goes blue, it's over. It's over."Trump, who won Florida with just over 100,000 votes in that campaign against Clinton, argued that electing Biden would lead to a national lockdown and subsequent economic collapse because of his more conservative approach to the virus.He predicted the US would see "the greatest red wave" in history on Tuesday: "Five days from now we are going to win Florida and we are going to win four more years in the White House," Trump said during the Tampa rally where he appeared with his wife, first lady Melania Trump.But for all of Trump's optimism about a potential "red wave," CNN's Poll of Polls shows Biden leading Trump in Florida 49% to 46% with no margin of sampling error.With Trump headed to Green Bay and Biden to Milwaukee on Friday, the picture looks even more difficult for the President in Wisconsin, which he won by less than a percentage point in 2016 and where Biden is leading Trump by a 9-point margin in CNN's Poll of Polls.Trump mocks Biden's coronavirus precautionsOne of the perils for Trump in Florida and parts of the Midwest is his sliding support among seniors, which has been driven in part by broad disapproval of his handling of the coronavirus and the fact that older voters have been disproportionately affected by Covid-19.In spite of that vulnerability, the President downplayed the fall surge in coronavirus cases during his huge rally in Tampa -- where few supporters wore masks and there was no social distancing. At one point, Trump told rallygoers: "We know the disease. We social distance. We do all of the things that you have to do. ... If you get close, wear a mask."Yet CNN's Maegan Vazquez and Donald Judd reported that most in Trump's Tampa crowd Thursday were standing shoulder-to-shoulder, packed so tightly together that several attendees required medical attention due to the heat.Trump on Thursday also mocked Biden for following US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and made fun of Biden's events where attendees are separated by circles, as well as his drive-in rallies, where voters are asked to stay by their cars to ensure proper distancing.While boasting that his own rallies could draw tens of thousands of people -- at a time when all reputable medical experts are asking Americans to avoid mass gatherings -- Trump claimed that the smaller attendance prescribed by the Biden campaign is driven by a lack of enthusiasm."Now they try and say it's because of Covid," Trump said. "They say the fact that he has nobody at all show up is because of Covid. No, it's because nobody shows up," Trump said to laughter in Tampa. "And I think that's the ultimate poll. And based on the numbers that we're getting, we're going to do really well on Tuesday."Biden criticized Trump's flaunting of safety guidelines: "Donald Trump just held a superspreader event here again. He's spreading more than just coronavirus. He's spreading division and discord," he said hours later in Tampa.  Earlier in Broward County, Biden chided Trump for refusing to listen to science and attributed the pain, suffering of the pandemic to Trump's "negligence." "Millions of people out there are out of work, on the edge. Can't see the light at the end of the tunnel and Donald Trump has given up," Biden said. "Donald Trump has waved the white flag, abandoned our families and surrendered to the virus. But the American people don't give up. We don't give in. And we surely don't cower, nor will I under any circumstances."(CNN) - This week is a kind of Hell Week, figuratively and literally.Our demons are coming out. The campaign signs dotting the streets in our neighborhoods are strewn in with gravestones and mock murder scenes and skeletons that this year feel a little more personal, having had death hang like a cloud over this year. We've all spent months slogging through a presidential election campaign and a global pandemic, and this Saturday feels like an emotionally climactic night, a morbid moment punctuating a year of death and suspense. Halloween, a daylight saving time change and a full moon all align on a singular night.While trick-or-treating and Halloween parties are curtailed this year due to physical distancing and concerns of spreading coronavirus, scholars say that acknowledging, if not fully celebrating, a night devoted to the demented is a useful escape valve. It's a way to purge the year's emotions before we declare our political intentions on November 3.Allowing for a little intentional chaos in our spirit might be a good thing. As the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche wrote, "One must have chaos in oneself to give birth to a dancing star."Halloween night is also a full moonThe narrative tension is tight, and that all this would converge on the night of a full moon only makes this spookier."It's a fraught moment for so many reasons. Even for those who don't believe in the supernatural, we act as if we do. The metaphysical energy of this moment is huge," said Regina Hansen, a master lecturer in rhetoric at Boston University and co-author of "Supernatural, Humanity, and the Soul: On the Highway to Hell and Back."Halloween is an opportunity to essentially be a stranger in a strange land. For a night you can inhabit a new self. That might mean the wish fulfillment of a child's dream to be an astronaut. You can inhabit a character who is braver, stronger or more criminal than you are."It's all heightened, it's all elevated. There's a sense of freedom that's almost magical," she said. "Children control the night. They walk up to strangers' houses and ask for, no, demand candy." Or it could be a way to express a message of political satire in going out as an undead version of a political figure you might like to banish.That could mean donning a bloodied suit and tie and parting your hair as a zombie politician (it's been done). Taboo thoughts are sanctioned, if only for an evening.This Halloween's full moon is also a blue moon. While the moon won't actually look blue, a blue moon refers to the second of two full moons occurring in the same month, which happens once every 2.5 to three years, or "once in a blue moon."A full moon appears on Halloween roughly every 19 years, so of course tack it up to 2020 for one more rare feat. Take note when the full moon rises on Saturday as it won't happen again on Halloween in many time zones until 2039, 2058, 2077 and 2096.Though full moons have long been tied to our fascination with madness and werewolves  -- the word "lunatic" derives from "lunar" --  there isn't strong scientific evidence that more crime occurs when the pale orb hangs fullest over our heads.Data is stacking up, however, that daylight saving time can unleash a little chaos. We have our lives calibrated and meted out to the letter, and then we shift our clocks to mess with order.The American Academy of Sleep Medicine in August published a position statement arguing that daylight saving time be abolished, blaming the biannual time shift for problems harming cardiovascular health and mental health, as well as leading to medication errors and traffic accidents.Eight states have officially passed legislation that would end our ritual of turning the clocks back, and another 32 have bills pending.There are ways to get ahead and prevent yourself from making mistakes due to a shift in circadian rhythm."You already know it's coming," said AASM President Dr. Kannan Ramar, a sleep medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic, in an earlier CNN interview. "A few days to a week prior to that, slowly shifting your schedule to that time frame is going to be helpful."A physically distanced HalloweenThough Halloween is a night to shake off your inhibitions, it's still vital to find ways to do that safely during the pandemic."Really try not to get together indoors with people not in your household. Instead, focus on getting people outdoors," said CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana S. Wen, who is an emergency physician and a visiting professor at George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. "There are lots of creative ways to celebrate Halloween outdoors, and it's much, much safer."New coronavirus cases are surging at a rate of nearly 70,000 new US cases each day. The seven-day average of new cases is at its highest level since the pandemic began, according to data from Johns Hopkins.Whether you have big plans for this weekend or not, there is value in taking a moment to acknowledge this moment, reflecting on our deep universal urge to confront our fear of death, and then, to live on in spite of it.A solitary celebration of the macabre during a pandemic might mean curling up with a Stephen King novel or a favorite horror film, Hansen, the literary scholar at Boston University, explained. Or it could be one of her Halloween favorites, Ray Bradbury's novel "The Halloween Tree," which tells of trick-or-treating children learning about origins of the holiday. The story waxes about children "just letting the sheer exhilaration of being alive and out on this night pull their lungs and shape their throats into a yell ... and a yell ... and a yeeeellll!"Just before a presidential election, it could be hocus-pocus to draw a line between Halloween, a full moon and a time change all happening simultaneously. But then again, maybe there's something there."The fact that we look for serendipity says a lot about us as human beings," Hansen said. "It could mean there's a purpose to our suffering, or at least a structure."(CNN) - In four key states -- Florida, North Carolina, Nevada and Iowa -- Republicans are beginning to narrow the Democratic advantage in pre-Election Day voting.More than 12 million ballots have been cast in these four states, which could be crucial in determining the next president.  The candidates' schedules reflect the focus on these states. President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden were both in Florida on Thursday campaigning for the state's 29 electoral votes. Later, Trump was set to travel to North Carolina, while Vice President Mike Pence was scheduled for campaign stops in Iowa and Nevada. Biden is due in Iowa on Friday.With five days until November 3, here's a deeper look at who's already voted in these key states, with data from Catalist, a company that provides data, analytics and other services to Democrats, academics and nonprofit issue-advocacy organizations  Florida  Trump won Florida by slightly over one percentage point last cycle. In the last week, voters under 30 have slightly increased their share of Florida's early voting electorate, from 8% to 10%. Other age groups have also seen small increases, further diminishing the dominance of Florida's senior voters 65 or older, who made up 45% of early voters a week ago, but now make up only 39%.  Florida's early voting electorate is slightly more diverse than at this time four years ago. Hispanic voters' share of the pre-Election Day vote has increased from 14% four years ago to 16% now, and Black voters' share has ticked slightly up from 12% then to 13% now. The vote from White voters is down three points from this point in 2016.  Republicans are narrowing the gap in pre-election ballots cast. Democrats currently lead by four points. A week ago, it was nine points. Party advantage is not predictive of outcome -- but nationwide polling shows many Republicans also prefer voting in person on Election Day rather than early. North CarolinaTrump won the Tar Heel State by more than three percentage points in 2016.  Young people are continuing to vote in large numbers in North Carolina. Last week, voters under 30 made up about 11% of early voters but that's now ticked up slightly to over 12%. Democrats have lost some of their lead in the pre-election vote. Last week, they had a 12-point advantage over Republicans in ballots cast. Currently, it stands at eight points.  By race, White voters account for the majority of ballots already cast in North Carolina at 72%, followed by Black voters with the second largest share of those ballots at 22%. This remains nearly identical to the racial composition of the early voting electorate four years ago. IowaIowa remains a competitive battleground this cycle after Trump won the Hawkeye State by more than nine percentage points in 2016. The state also has a key Senate race between incumbent Republican Joni Ernst and Democratic challenger Theresa Greenfield.Democrats continue to cast pre-election ballots at a much higher rate than Republicans, similar to 2016. At 49% of the pre-election vote, Democrats have a 17-point lead over Republicans, who stand at 32%. Republicans, however, have slightly narrowed that gap over the last week by four points.By race, Iowa's current pre-Election Day electorate is similar to this point in 2016, with White voters comprising the vast majority of early voters at 94%. Iowa hasn't seen as large a shift in age breakdown as some other states. Voters under 30 make up 10% of all early voters -- up only three points from this time four years ago. Voters 30-64 are up five points from 42% of turnout at this point four years ago to 47% now. Voters 65 and older make up a smaller share of early voters than at this point four years ago. NevadaNevada had a narrow margin of defeat for Trump four years ago, with about two percentage points separating him from Hillary Clinton. Nevada's early voting electorate is trending younger compared to the last week. Eleven percent of voters so far are under 30; last week it was only 9%. Voters 65 or older have gone from 40% of early voters last week to 35% now. About two-thirds of Nevada's pre-election ballots come from White voters, which is a small decrease from 70% four years ago. Hispanic voters make up the second largest share of those ballots at 13%, a slight uptick from in 2016. Black voters and Asian voters have also seen one-percentage-point increases in their shares of the early vote. Republicans are narrowing the Democratic advantage in the pre-election vote. Last week, Democrats led Republicans by 12 points. As more ballots have been returned in the vote-by-mail state, the 42% of ballots cast by Democrats is now only seven points higher than Republicans' 35%.  CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect Trump's 2016 defeat in Nevada.Washington  (CNN) - President Donald Trump has spent much of the week before Election Day spreading disinformation about the voting process.   On Monday, he continued efforts to discredit mail-in ballots and claimed we "must have a final total by Nov. 3," which Twitter flagged as misleading and blocked users from seeing on their feeds. CNN has previously fact-checked similar comments: this is a misinterpretation of how the system works and an unrealistic expectation for 2020's pandemic-era election.  On Tuesday, Trump suggested voters can change their votes, tweeting: "Strongly Trending (Google) since immediately after the second debate is CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE? This refers changing it to me. The answer in most states is YES. Go do it. Most important Election of your life!"  Facts First: This is misleading at best. In "most" states, once your ballot has been cast, either in the mail or in person, you cannot change your vote.   In response to the President's tweet, CNN reached out to all 50 states about their policies regarding changing one's vote. All but five responded. Of those that did, all but six told CNN that voters are not allowed to change their votes. The remaining six -- Delaware, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York and Wisconsin -- provided information about processes they do have in place or provisions in state law which would allow someone to change their vote."For the most part, this is not allowed," Amber McReynolds, the former director of elections in Denver and now CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute, a mail-balloting advocacy group, told CNN. "The standard practice is usually first ballot in the door. You can't change your mind after you submitted."   In some states, it depends on how they define submitted. For example, Gabe Rosenberg, communications director for Connecticut's secretary of state, told CNN voters in Connecticut cannot change their vote but a state statute allows those who voted by mail to withdraw their absentee ballot if they request to do so in person by 5 p.m. Friday at the latest. That ballot would then be invalidated and their vote not counted.  Voters could then request another absentee ballot or choose to vote in person. In theory, someone could vote for one candidate on the absentee ballot, change their mind, and then record their vote for another candidate. Rosenberg however insists that's not technically changing their vote because the initial choice was never recorded or counted. Several states do have policies for people who may have received and filled out an absentee ballot but not yet dropped it off or put it in the mail and now wish to change their vote. In that case, some states allow voters to request a replacement ballot or vote in person instead and "spoil" or void the initial absentee ballot. Others, like Texas, require voters to bring their spoiled ballot to a polling place and surrender it. And in New Mexico, for example, voters who requested an absentee ballot have to sign an affidavit stating that they don't intend to submit it in order to vote in person.While this could technically allow someone to change what they may have filled out on an initial ballot, it is not quite the same as changing your vote.   "It's very difficult to change your vote once it's in the hopper," Wendy Underhill, director of Elections & Redistricting for the National Conference of State Legislatures, told CNN's Kelly Mena. "The deciding point is, has your first ballot been received and accounted for and if not, you may have a chance to go in and say: 'I want to do it differently.' "  However, a few states do clearly support a voter's ability to change their vote. Here are the details:  MichiganMichigan allows voters to invalidate or "spoil" their absentee ballot and receive a new one despite having already voted and returned it.  Voters have to request the new mail-in ballot before 5 p.m. on the Friday prior to the election or in person before 4 p.m. on the Monday prior to the election. Minnesota  In Minnesota, "a voter with an accepted ballot may request to spoil their ballot and receive a replacement" until two weeks before the election. Usually, the request can be made up to a week before the election, but under the new policy due to Covid-19, voters would not be able to change their vote if they wished to do so following the President's tweet, given how close it was to the election.Wisconsin  In Wisconsin, voters can spoil their ballot twice if they make a mistake or change their mind, regardless of whether they're voting at a polling place or by mail. Those who have submitted an absentee ballot but want to change their vote must request a new ballot in writing or at the clerk's office in person until 5 p.m. on the Thursday before an election. Once the initial ballot is spoiled, voters can go vote in person or request another absentee ballot. If the second or third ballot does not arrive at the clerk's office by Election Day, it will not be counted.   New York  In New York, it depends on the method used to vote. Those who request and cast an absentee ballot can request another or vote in person to change their vote. However, if you vote in person early, that vote may not be changed.   New Hampshire  In New Hampshire, the timing is critical. Someone could change their vote by voting in person before their absentee ballot has been processed because those are processed later in the day on Election Day. The state's deadline for absentee ballots to be received is 5 p.m. on Election Day. Delaware   In Delaware, if a voter wants to change their vote after already submitting their absentee or vote by mail ballot, they have to contact their county elections office. The county elections office will let the voter know if the ballot has already been processed or prepared for scanning and tabulation. If not, the voter could request to change their vote.(CNN) - It'll take a lot more than an election for America to regain the trust of its allies after four years of the most norm-shattering US presidency in history.President Donald Trump's administration has already rocked confidence in the US-led international order to such an extent that experts fear the damage done to global democratic norms could take decades to restore.   From befriending autocratic strongmen to undermining multi-national institutions -- and even questioning the legitimacy American democracy -- Trump presided over a deliberate shift in the reliability of Reagan's "shining city on a hill."   "He's normalized things that were taboo. If any other Western leader acted like Trump, they'd be marginalized," said Nanjala Nyabola, a political analyst based in Nairobi. "As leader of one of the most powerful nation on earth, he's been able to behave with complete disregard for the institutions and norms that rely on good faith and trust in the international community. Undercutting that will be Trump's lasting legacy."   Perhaps the clearest examples of Trump's apparent disdain for democracy can be seen in his admiration for autocrats and authoritarians elsewhere. He has called the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia a "friend of mine" who is doing a "really spectacular job". Saudi citizens do not get to vote and are ruled by a royal family who have spent decades presiding over human rights abuses.   He has called North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un a "real leader" with whom he gets on "really well". North Korea is probably the worst example of a dictatorship on earth, with dissidents imprisoned in gulags and opponents performatively executed by a ruling family who are deified in state media.   "When the President of the United States congratulates authoritarians for winning unfair elections or calls genuine dictators his friend, it gives those leaders the propaganda win of an endorsement from the supposed moral leader of the world," says Nic Cheeseman, professor of democracy at the University of Birmingham. "When you combine these endorsements with Trump's reduced presence on the world stage, he has created space for strongman to behave even more aggressively at home and internationally."   Trump has shown little interest in taking autocrats to task, even for grievous abuses. When journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered by a Saudi hit squad, Trump gave the Crown Prince a pass, saying the Middle East was "a vicious, hostile place." After Russia meddled in the 2016 US election, Trump repeatedly refused to condemn Putin. And at a G7 summit last year, Trump reportedly referred to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi -- a key US ally long accused of human rights abuses -- as "my favorite dictator."Over the past four years, Trump has also withdrawn from international agreements and questioned the relevance of international institutions that have historically relied on America's political and financial support.   His actions have the direct and immediate impact of reducing the effectiveness of multilateralism. "When Trump pulls out of the World Health Organization in the middle of a pandemic and accuses it of working with China, he risks destroying the long-term credibility of international bodies in dealing with global crises," says Cheeseman. "When he pulls out of treaties like the Paris climate accord, he reduces the international community's ability to ask a country to stop chopping down trees. If the US is no longer a stakeholder, why should anyone else be?"   Nyabola thinks that the long-term impact of Trump's unilateralism carries two significant risks. First, his criticisms of institutions like NATO and the UN could "unravel decades of work that went into creating forums built on trust and honestly." Second, she believes that his unrestrained style of leadership has "changed international expectations of the office of president." Those expectations might include standing beside democratic nations when their independence is threated, or protecting Western security interests and promoting stability, rather than befriending and congratulating hostile actors who seek to undermine these principles.  This creates a problem for those who succeed Trump -- either now or in four years -- who would like to present his presidency as an aberration. "His rhetoric and behavior have changed what friends and enemies can claim to expect from a US president," says Jennifer Cassidy, a diplomatic scholar at Oxford University. "This means a country like Iran now has a free pass to say they will never negotiate with the US again. What is the point, they can credibly claim, if someone like Trump comes along again and rips it all up?"  Trump's transformation of America's global standing will cast a shadow over whoever eventually replaces him as president. If that's Joe Biden this January, it's likely he will try and restore some of America's international relations from day one. The difficulty he faces is, no matter how loudly he champions returning to normal, Trump happened once and the rest of the world is aware he could happen again. "Trump 2.0 could be a younger, more intellectually coherent prospect. They could have a more overt desire to tear apart the post-war world order," says Cheeseman.    No matter how much those who revered the American-led world order might want a new administration to flick a switch which undoes the past four years, it's going to take time for the US to be fully trusted by allies again. And while it rebuilds that trust, those who oppose Western democracy will continue to occupy the space that Trump afforded them when he vacated his post as leader of the free world. (CNN) - Whoever wins the presidential race can use the full power of the presidency only if he has a Senate backing him up. Currently, Republicans hold 53 of 100 seats. Democrats need a net gain of three seats to take back Congress' upper body, assuming former Vice President Joe Biden wins and Kamala Harris, as vice president, would cast a tie-breaking vote. Right now, it looks like Democrats are going to get a majority, but the battle for control remains close and will likely be determined by two related factors:      First, Democrats are far more likely to win Senate control if Biden wins the presidency.       Second, climbing coronavirus cases could make an impact in the closing days of the campaign. Take a look at the five Republican-held seats that are most likely to flip at this point to the Democrats: Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Maine and North Carolina. As of this writing, Democratic Senate candidates hold polling advantages of 5 points in Arizona, 9 points in Colorado, 1 point in Iowa, 5 points in Maine and 3 points in North Carolina. Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 raceThe races in Iowa and North Carolina remain particularly close at this point, and Democrats will probably need to win at least one of those to take the Senate. Their chance of doing this will be increased significantly if Biden defeats President Donald Trump in these states. At this point, that looks quite possible. Biden leads Trump in all five of the states where Democrats have their best Senate pickup opportunities. Those advantages tend to be fairly close to the lead Democratic Senate candidates have in those same states: 3 points in Arizona, 13 points in Colorado, 1 point in Iowa, 15 points in Maine and 2 points in North Carolina. The average difference across these states is just 3 points, with Maine being a notable exception to the overall trend. Likewise, the one seat Republicans are favored to pick up (Alabama) shows the same premise: the party winning in the presidential race is leading in the Senate race as well. Indeed, the Democrats' best chance of expanding the Senate map is in a state where Biden has been making clear gains against Trump: Georgia. Biden now holds an average 2-point edge over Trump in the Peach State, where there are two competitive Senate races. In the race for a full six-year term, the battle between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Sen. David Perdue has grown quite tight in recent weeks. In fact, the two are tied in an average of polls. The complication is that it isn't enough just to get the most votes in Georgia. You need to win a majority to avoid a January runoff. With a Libertarian candidate polling at 2% to 3%, it's possible that no candidate reaches a majority.The better Biden does in Georgia, the better shot Ossoff has of avoiding a runoff. (Georgia's other special Senate election is very likely to head to a runoff, with multiple Democrats and Republicans running in what is known as a jungle primary.) Beyond these aforementioned states, Democrats are down 4 and 3 points in Kansas and Montana, respectively. Those are small enough Republican leads that the Democrats could win in these states, but with Trump ahead in both, it'll be tough. One thing that could make a difference in all these Senate races is the rising number of coronavirus cases nationwide. In every single one of the states with the best chance of a party picking up a seat, cases are climbing upward. Cases are rising particularly quickly in Iowa, where Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds has refused to institute a mask mandate. This is a state where Biden's advantage seems to have been widening somewhat in the last few weeks, along with Wisconsin (where cases are also rising). Although Wisconsin doesn't have a Senate race this year, Iowa does. As I pointed out Thursday, Trump seems to be doing worse in communities where Covid-19 deaths are higher.That could make the difference in a state like Iowa in the presidential race, which could in turn shift the Senate race -- one that ultimately could determine control of the US Senate. Washington  (CNN) - Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden attacked President Donald Trump's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in an op-ed for a Korean media outlet Friday and promised to engage in "principled diplomacy" in pursuing the denuclearization of North Korea.In an op-ed published in South Korea's Yonhap News Agency, Biden criticized Trump's "failed leadership" during the pandemic, claiming he has "tanked our economy and shattered hope for many Korean Americans."Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race"President Trump knew how deadly COVID-19 was back in January and did nothing to control it," Biden wrote. "More than 225,000 Americans are dead. Some 30 million have lost jobs, hours, wages. One in five small businesses have shut down, many of them Korean American-owned small businesses."Biden's op-ed was a direct and striking criticism of a sitting US leader in a foreign media outlet, and Yonhap called the piece the "first of its kind to a South Korean media company in the year of the US presidential election." The op-ed dropped just days ahead of Election Day in the US, where disarming North Korea remains one of the most challenging foreign policy issues for whomever wins the White House. The former vice president sought to contrast himself with Trump's approach to diplomacy in the Korean Peninsula in his attempts to get North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un to agree to total denuclearization up-front."Words matter -- and a president's words matter even more. As President, I'll stand with South Korea, strengthening our alliance to safeguard peace in East Asia and beyond, rather than extorting Seoul with reckless threats to remove our troops," Biden wrote. View 2020 presidential election pollingIn comments made to donors, first reported by The Washington Post, Trump, in 2018, appeared to threaten to withdraw US troops from South Korea if he can't get a better trade deal with Seoul. The Trump administration also previously sought to get South Korea to pay roughly 400% more to cover the cost of keeping US troops on the peninsula.In his op-ed, Biden wrote that if elected he'll "engage in principled diplomacy and keep pressing toward a denuclearized North Korea and a unified Korean Peninsula, while working to reunite Korean-Americans separated from loved ones in North Korea for decades."He added that as president he would work to fix the immigration system to provide a "roadmap to citizenship for undocumented Koreans," as he said about 2 million Korean-Americans have made "innumerable contributions" to the country."As President, I'll continue to defend the American Dream for everyone, so every Korean American family has the same fair shot at prosperity and a better future," he wrote.Biden has been critical of Trump's relationship with Kim. In a Democratic primary debate back in January, Biden said he would not meet with Kim without preconditions, and that he would instead push China and other Asian neighbors to pressure the country to abandon its nuclear ambitions.Build your own road to 270 electoral votes with CNN's interactive mapTrump met with Kim three times over his presidency, first in Singapore, then Vietnam and finally at the Demilitarized Zone dividing North and South Korea  becoming the first sitting US leader to set foot in the hermit kingdom. But negotiations have been at an impasse since.Pyongyang has not tested any nuclear weapons or long-range missiles since November 2017, but has continued testing shorter-range missiles that could be used to target US troops or allies in the region.On October 10, North Korea unveiled what analysts believed to be one of the world's largest ballistic missiles at a military parade on a significant anniversary in Pyongyang. (Reuters) - South Korean officials are stepping up efforts to ensure locals stick to social distancing guidelines during Halloween, warning this year's party "could really turn scary" as it tries to avoid another resurgence in coronavirus infections.Officials are patrolling nightclubs in the capital Seoul to make sure they adhere to social distancing rules and are advising people to host Halloween parties online, Park Yoo-mi, a general director of the city government, told a briefing on Friday."Don't end up a real ghost while enjoying Halloween," reads the caption on one poster in Seoul.Another warned this year's party "could really turn scary."South Korea has been praised for quick and effective action against the pandemic but saw a resurgence in cases in May after an outbreak linked to nightclubs and bars in Seoul.Seoul's government has dispatched officials and police to 153 nightclubs in the city ahead of the weekend to make sure facilities follow strict guidelines and visitors log in names and use quick response (QR) code systems for contract tracing, said city official Park.Some 14 nightclubs have already been shut after failing to adhere to social distancing guidelines and for having more people than are allowed at nightclubs, Park said."The city plans to reap immediate results from prevention measures by ordering a two-week ban on gatherings for the facilities that violate the guidelines," she added.Park urged other businesses to join the 85 night venues in Seoul which have said they would voluntarily shut their doors during Halloween to protect against the spread of the virus.South Korea has used aggressive testing and contact tracing in a bid to contain the virus, which has infected 26,385 people and killed 463 in the country, according to the latest data from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. Daily cases have hovered around 100 over the past week.(CNN) - Bette Midler has officially won Halloween.The actress pulled off what fans of her hit 1993 movie "Hocus Pocus" have been waiting for -- a reunion!And it was nothing short of epic.

The virtual event on Friday night was for her non-profit, the New York Restoration Project, which works to restore gardens and parks in New York's five boroughs.This year was dubbed, "In Search of the Sanderson Sisters: A Hocus Pocus Hulaween Takeover," and it featured Billy Crystal, John Stamos, Glenn Close and the one and only Meryl Streep.The one-hour event was a mock documentary about the history of the Sanderson Sisters, with stars telling their own versions of mock encounters with the witches. But that's not all, more of the film's original stars like Thora Birch, who played Dani, and her on screen big brother, Omri Katz, made appearances. Even Sarah Silverman, Martin Short, Kenan Thompson, and Adam Lambert joined in on the fun.Now let's talk about the epic finale ... Mariah Carey! We did not see that one coming, but leave it to Midler to knock our Halloween socks off. Carey basically told Midler to get lost at the end so that she could move on from Halloween and embark on her favorite time of the year -- Christmas. Viewers even got to hear her hit, "All I Want For Christmas" as it played everyone into the credits.This event definitely got us in the spirit. Tis the season, ya'll. (CNN) - Idaho Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin and 10 Republican state legislators (or legislators to be) appeared in a video earlier this week in which they seemed to openly question the existence of the coronavirus pandemic while also insisting they would follow no state or local emergency orders relating to the fight against Covid-19."The fact that a pandemic may or may not be occurring changes nothing about the meaning or intent of state's constitution and the preservation of our inalienable rights," says Karey Hanks, who is running unopposed for a state House seat, in the video.McGeachin, who has repeatedly clashed with Republican Gov. Brad Little over what she believes to be his onerous response to the pandemic, is featured in the video holding a Bible -- and then placing a gun on said Bible -- as she reads from the state's Constitution.Each person in the video, including Hanks, read lines from a statement they all signed.The video is the work of the Idaho Freedom Foundation, which describes itself as a "libertarian think tank" based in Boise. It was posted on the group's YouTube site on Tuesday to coincide with Little's latest decision to move the state back to Phase 3 in its response to the pandemic."My fellow Idahoans, we are in a crisis with our health care system in Idaho due to the pandemic," Little said earlier this week. "I sincerely hope that some people have passed the point of thinking the pandemic is not real or is not a big deal, or that their personal actions don't really affect anything."Coronavirus cases are up by 46% over the last two weeks, according to The New York Times' data. Deaths from the virus have gone up 172% in that same period of time. Despite those numbers, McGeachin immediately criticized Little's move. "I am disappointed that the governor believes our state needs to impose more restrictions on our already struggling businesses and limit the choice of individuals regarding their gatherings," she wrote on her Facebook page. "Respecting individual liberty and property rights must remain the foundation of all policy decisions in our state."(Worth noting: The main changes Little is imposing by returning to Phase 3 in the pandemic response are limiting gatherings to 50 people and under and forcing people who visit nursing homes to wear masks. So not exactly radical changes in Idahoans' ways of life.)McGeachin has clashed with Little repeatedly since the start of the pandemic. Earlier this year, the Idaho Statesman's Cynthia Sewell reported that the two top Republican elected officials hadn't spoken to each other in weeks, and that McGeachin had personally defied Little's executive orders to control the spread of the coronavirus in the Gem State.As Sewell wrote of McGeachin:"She left the Legislature's 2020 session early  the lieutenant governor presides over the Senate  to attend to her family business, a restaurant and pub in Idaho Falls. She has attended or supported rallies opposing Little's stay-home order and has been urging him to let businesses re-open. She defied his state order earlier this month to attend an event at a North Idaho brewery that re-opened despite Little's order."This latest statement by McGeachin -- and 10 of her fellow Republicans -- goes beyond simply criticizing Little for his "draconian" (McGeachin's word) policies in regard to containing the spread of Covid-19. The Idaho Freedom Foundation statement seems to openly question whether the coronavirus is actually a pandemic, which is a weird argument to make, given that 44 million people worldwide have been sickened by it and more than 1.1 million have died from it.McGeachin's high-profile critique of Little is explained by, you guessed it, politics! The governor and lieutenant governor in Idaho are not elected as a ticket, meaning that McGeachin holds no real loyalty to Little despite the fact that they are both Republicans.  While he spent a decade as lieutenant governor, she is a former state representative and small business owner. He represents the establishment within the GOP; she stands for the Trump wing.The tension could well come to a head in 2022, when Little will be up for a second term and McGeachin will have the right of refusal when it comes to challenging him.(CNN) - The Louisville, Kentucky, police officer who was shot while executing a no-knock warrant at Breonna Taylor's home has sued her boyfriend Kenneth Walker III for battery, assault and emotional distress, court documents show. Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly claims he is entitled to damages for medical treatment, trauma and pain he suffered after he was fired upon by Walker, who was with Taylor, 26, the moment she was fatally shot by police.Mattingly's attorney, Kent Wicker, said in a statement his client was "shot and nearly killed" by Walker. "He's entitled to, and should, use the legal process to seek a remedy for the injury that Walker has caused him," Wicker said in a statement. Walker previously filed a $10.5 million lawsuit against the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the Louisville/Jefferson County metro government and members of the Louisville Metro Police Department, seeking damages for false arrest, malicious prosecution and assault, among other claims. Mattingly's lawsuit is a counterclaim to Walker's.On Friday, Walker's attorney, Steve Romines, called Mattingly's lawsuit "the latest in a cycle of police aggression, deflection of responsibility, and obstruction of the facts in what is an obvious coverup." "The counterclaim just brings it full circle. If Kenny can be sued for defending himself, make no mistake, all lawful gun owners' rights are at risk. And that should scare everyone," Romines said. "We intend to defend Kenny  once again  from baseless charges intended to harm, intimidate, and cover up the events of March 13th." The countersuitAccording to Mattingly's lawsuit, police forced entry after "repeatedly" knocking and announcing their presence at Taylor's home in the early hours of March 13. "As the door opened, Mattingly saw Walker standing down the hallway with his gun trained at him. At the same moment, Mattingly felt a sharp, hot pain in his leg and realized he had been shot by Walker," the lawsuit says. "The shot struck Sergeant Mattingly in his femoral artery, in his upper thigh, and caused serious injury to Mattingly that required emergency medical attention." In response, Mattingly, who was at the entrance of Taylor's home, fired six shots down the hallway, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron said in a news conference in late September. Detective Myles Cosgrove, who was also in the doorway, shot 16 times, and former detective Brett Hankison fired his weapon 10 times, "including from an outside sliding glass door and through a bedroom window," Cameron said. An investigation by Cameron's office found LMPD officers were justified in their use of force -- which led to Taylor's death -- because they were responding to the shot fired by Walker. An FBI ballistics analysis showed Cosgrove fired the shot that killed Taylor, Cameron said. Romines, Walker's attorney, has told CNN that "ballistics do not establish that Walker shot Mattingly." Walker has maintained he discharged his weapon under Kentucky's "stand your ground" law, because he thought intruders were breaking into Taylor's home. Walker was initially charged with attempted murder, but the charge was later dropped. Walker has agreed the officers knocked, but he has repeatedly said he didn't hear them identify themselves as police -- otherwise he would not have grabbed his gun.Grand jurors scrutinize AG's handling of caseTaylor's death has fueled months of protests over racial injustice and police brutality, along with the deaths of other Black people at the hands of police, like George Floyd in Minneapolis and Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta, among others. Mattingly spoke with ABC News and the Courier Journal newspaper in Louisville earlier this month to give his first public comments on the shooting . "He wasn't shooting at the ground," Mattingly told "Good Morning America" of Walker. "He's pushed out with two hands looking straight at me. I saw his gun. Our postures were the same, looking at each other, when he fired that shot." Mattingly also said the shooting had nothing to do with race or racial profiling. Ultimately, only one officer, Hankison, was indicted on three counts of wanton endangerment in the first degree in connection with Taylor's death. He was not charged with causing her death, but for "wantonly and blindly" firing at her apartment. Some of those bullets went through her apartment and into one next door, where three people were inside, including a pregnant woman and a child. Hankison has pleaded not guilty. The attorney general's handling of the case has come under increased scrutiny, including from two anonymous grand jurors who heard Cameron's presentation of the case. Two of them told journalists this week that prosecutors were dismissive of their questions and there was an "uproar" when the grand jurors realized Louisville police officers would not be charged in Taylor's death. Six potential homicide charges were not considered against the LMPD officers who fired their weapons into Taylor's apartment, because they were "justified in the return of deadly fire," after Walker shot, Cameron said last month. He said the "grand jury agreed."Anonymous Grand Juror No. 1 disputed his comments, calling them inaccurate. "Even though we asked for other charges to be brought, we were never told of any additional charges. We were just told that they didn't feel that they can make any charges stick" and that LMPD officers were justified in returning fire, the juror said.(CNN) - With three days to go in a campaign that's been dominated by the pandemic, President Donald Trump made the baseless and politically perilous claim that American doctors are profiting from Covid-19 deaths during a visit to the critical electoral region of the Midwest, where former Vice President Biden offered a contrasting message about unity and promised a more forceful response to defeat the virus.Trump's appalling attack on doctors came on a day when the US marked a new daily record for coronavirus cases and 17 states were seeing record hospitalizations. Instead of addressing those challenges, the President tried to explain the mounting US case count by making the false claim in Michigan that US doctors are inflating coronavirus case numbers because they "get more money if someone dies from Covid.""Our doctors are very smart people. So what they do is they say, 'I'm sorry but everybody dies of Covid,' " Trump said at a rally in Waterford Township, Michigan, on Friday. Unearthing conspiracy theories from the bowels of the Internet, the President claimed with no evidence that doctors from other countries list underlying diseases as the cause of death, while US doctors choose coronavirus."With us, when in doubt -- choose Covid," Trump said. "Now they'll say 'Oh that's terrible what he said,' but that's true. It's like $2,000 more, so you get more money."Trump's falsehood about doctors on the front lines of the pandemic angered Biden, who criticized the President for attacking first-responders at his subsequent rallies in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, and in Milwaukee."The President of the United States is accusing the medical profession of making up Covid deaths so they make more money. Doctors and nurses go to work every day to save lives. They do their jobs. Donald Trump should stop attacking them and do his job," Biden said in Minnesota.View Trump and Biden head-to-head pollingThe clashing messages of the two candidates stood in stark contrast as they both campaigned in Wisconsin and Minnesota on Friday, with each man attempting to broaden his potential path to 270 electoral votes. Trump won Wisconsin by less than a percentage point in 2016 but narrowly lost Minnesota, and he and Biden are now vying for those pivotal blue-collar voters who abandoned Democrats four years ago to choose Trump's outsider message.Though some of those voters have drifted away from the President because they disapprove of his handling of the virus, he has continued to insist on holding huge rallies  he has more than a dozen planned in seven states before Election Day, including four in Pennsylvania on Saturday alone  which only draws attention to the fact that he is dangerously flouting the safety guidelines of his own experts at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, daring Americans to hold him accountable for it on Election Day.Biden delivered a closing argument grounded in his desire to unify the country and be a president for all people, pledging to work "as hard for those who don't support me as those who do."  The former vice president told Minnesota voters that Trump has "simply given up" and questioned how many lives could have been saved if Trump had been candid with the American people about the risks the virus posed early this year. The former vice president also pleaded with voters not to give up their sense of optimism, while acknowledging that was a difficult request at a time when nearly 230,000 Americans have died from the virus.Meanwhile, Trump slashed against the "arrogant, far-left political class," suggested Biden would flood Minnesota with terrorist refugees, and made the wild claim that Democrats like Biden want to "imprison you in your homes while letting anarchists, agitators and vandals roam free as they destroy your cities and states."Trump's claims about profiteering doctors sparked a backlash beyond the campaign trail. Susan Bailey, the president of the American Medical Association, said in a statement that the claim that doctors are overcounting Covid-19 patients or "lying to line their pockets is a malicious, outrageous, and completely misguided charge.""Covid-19 cases are at record highs today," Bailey said as Friday marked the highest single day of cases in the United States since the pandemic began. "Rather than attacking us and lobbing baseless charges at physicians, our leaders should be following the science and urging adherence to the public health steps we know work -- wearing a mask, washing hands and practicing physical distancing."Emergency physician and former Baltimore Health Commissioner Dr. Leana Wen told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Friday night that doctors are risking their lives at a time when one person is now being diagnosed with Covid-19 every second."We have one American dying of coronavirus every two minutes, and that number is increasing," Wen said on "The Situation Room." "In some states, one in two people who are getting tested are testing positive. That means that we're not doing nearly enough testing, and that every person who tests positive is a canary in a coal mine." Wen added that there are likely to be "many more dozens of other cases that we're not detecting, and that escalation is going to increase in the weeks to come."Trump rails against nation's Covid-19 focusThe angry tone of Trump's rallies and his attacks on doctors stem in part from his frustration that the country is so focused on the pandemic in the closing days of the election. Poll after poll has shown that coronavirus is the top issue on the minds of American voters and a broad majority of the electorate disapproves of Trump's handling of the virus. While Trump has gotten away with holding large rallies in other states, Minnesota has been particularly vigilant both with enforcement and contact tracing, and Trump lashed out on Friday at Minnesota officials who curtailed the size of his rally due to safety concerns.The Minnesota Department of Health reported three Covid-19 outbreaks related to Trump campaign events held in the state in September. The state's health department has linked at least 23 cases to Trump campaign rallies with the President in Bemidji and Duluth and a rally with Vice President Mike Pence in Minneapolis, according to information the department provided to CNN in an email last week.But dismissing safety concerns as irrelevant, Trump argued that state officials, including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Democrat, have created two sets of standards  one for the protesters who demonstrated against police brutality after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May and a different set for his supporters."Keith Ellison sided with flag burning extremists over law-abiding Americans. He treats you like second-class citizens," Trump said in Rochester, Minnesota, on Friday night where state officials limited the crowd to 250 people. "He believes that the pro-American voters have fewer rights than anti-American demonstrators."As part of that argument, Trump once again conflated Black Lives Matter demonstrations, which were largely peaceful across the country this year, with the far smaller number of protests that turned violent and have served as a helpful foil as he tries to argue that Biden would coddle criminals while fomenting what he described as "vile anti-police rhetoric."Speaking in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St. Paul, Biden refuted that argument by zeroing in on the difference between peaceful protesters and violent agitators who took advantage of this year's movement for racial justice."Burning and looting is not protesting, it's violence clear and simple -- and will not be tolerated," Biden said at his event, which he said was seven miles from where Floyd was killed by a police officer. "But these protests are a cry for justice."The former vice president argued that Trump's divisive language about the protests and his effort to pit Americans "against one another based on race, gender, ethnicity and national origin" are part of an effort to distract from his handling of the pandemic.During his final event of the day in Milwaukee, Biden noted that the state is now experiencing a record level of coronavirus hospitalizations."This week, Wisconsin, like other states, set a new record for daily cases. Hospitals are running short on beds, just had to open a field hospital. That's what we're facing. We've now hit 9 million cases," Biden said Friday night. "Millions of people out of work; on the edge and they can't see the light. They're not sure how dark it's going to remain ... and the thing that bothers me the most was a President who gave up."Its been three years since the Me Too movement took off like wildfire through Hollywood, the halls of Congress, and Wall Street. While we found out about Congress slush fund for sexual assault claims, it took a while for the movement to hit the bureaucratic agencies in the same way. Its notoriously difficult to fire a federal employee for any reason, so victims fearing retaliation are still deterred from coming forward.Survivors of these crimes should not be the ones who live in terror of being further victimized, said Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, who has her own history with an abusive ex-husband. Those who prey on others are the ones who should fear the consequences of their actions.Ernst, also a survivor of sexual assault, is proposing a bill aptly titled the Compulsory Requirement to Eliminate Employees who are Perpetrators of Sexual Assault, or CREEPS, Act to terminate any federal employee who has been criminally convicted of sexual assault.Lets make it perfectly clear to any potential or present predators in the federal workforce: No matter who you are or what your title or rank may be, if you are a creep, your career should be over  and my CREEPS Act would do just that, Ernst says.Its hard to believe its nearly 2021 and victims of sexual assault are forced to work with their victimizers every day. Why do we have to pass a bill requiring that predators, having been found guilty of assault, be fired by law from their taxpayer-funded jobs? This seems like common sense, and it seems eminently reasonable that a victim not be forced to work with someone convicted of assaulting him or her  but its the government, so here we are.Since 2017, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Interior Department reported spikes in the number of assault and harassment allegations reported internally. In its 2018 report to Congress, the former detailed 22 allegations of sexual assault. Other agencies have also come under fire, including the State Department and the Forest Service.The Forest Service has a long, dark past on the issue. One 1995 class-action lawsuit against the Forest Service was filed on behalf of 6,000 women. More recently, in 2016, the Forest Service found 150 cases of harassment filed with the agency.These numbers dont tell the whole story because most survivors dont come forward for many reasons: They think they wont be believed, the subject is uncomfortable, they lack confidence about confidentiality, and retaliation is a very real fear and possibility.While the feminist left likely wont recognize Ernst for her efforts, this lawmaker, the first female combat veteran elected to the U.S. Senate, has made ending sexual misconduct in the military and throughout the federal workforce a priority since she was elected in 2014.That year, Ernst gained a national following by promising to make the big spenders in Washington squeal like pigs being castrated, a chore she had to do while growing up on the family farm in Iowa. She now gives out a monthly Squeal Award to those abusing taxpayer dollars, and this month she gave the unsavory prize to the creeps on the publics payroll who make unwelcomed, inappropriate, and illegal sexual advances on civil servants in the workplace, or on anyone else.Ernsts bill to terminate rapists and other creeps in the federal workforce is the only solution to fixing the problem, other than maybe applying those hog-castrating tactics. That would really make the pigs who cant keep their hands to themselves squeal!Ernst, herself a survivor of sexual assault, is proposing a bill to terminate any federal employee who has been criminally convicted of sexual assault.Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf slammed Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey over censorship of the U.S. border chief as a threat to national security.Ill lead an effective strategy to mobilize trunalimunumaprzure, Biden said in Pennsylvania.Bidens most favorable pollster in the Sunshine State, Quinnipiac, now shows Trump gaining 2 points and Biden losing 6 points. An ad in California is smearing opponents of a ballot proposition overturning a state ban on affirmative action as racist white supremacists.
