(CNN)Kentucky state Rep. Attica Scott, the state's only Black female legislator, was among 24 people arrested Thursday by the Louisville Metro Police Department during Breonna Taylor protests, the Democratic lawmaker confirmed to CNN after her release from custody Friday morning.Scott -- who in August had pre-filed legislation to end the use of no-knock warrants in Kentucky, known as "Breonna's Law" -- and her 19-year-old daughter Ashanti were charged with unlawful assembly, failure to disperse, and rioting, police records show."I'm very traumatized," Scott said. She says she's innocent of all charges and was peacefully seeking authorized sanctuary at a church before the curfew time.According to police, a group of protestors began "causing damage" in downtown Louisville -- including breaking windows of a restaurant and tossing a flare into a library -- before the county-wide 9 p.m. curfew kicked in."Protestors made their way to the First Unitarian Church at 809 S 4th Street. People gathered on the property of the church, which allowed them to stay there as the curfew had expired," a police department statement said.Scott says she was arrested at 8:58 p.m., two minutes before the curfew started, as she and other protesters crossed the street to seek sanctuary at the church."How could I have been breaking curfew before curfew even began?" she asked.The curfew, enacted by Mayor Greg Fischer on Wednesday ahead of the announcement by Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron on a grand jury decision in the Taylor case, doesn't apply to those commuting to houses of worship."In Breonna's name, neither I or my teenage daughter who was arrested with me tried to burn down a library that our people need," Scott said at a press conference earlier Friday morning. "Those are some ridiculous charges that are levied against us."Scott recorded video of herself walking to the First Unitarian Church of Louisville, showing police officers and police vans on street corners as they walked past a library on their way towards the church.Five minutes into the video, Scott and fellow demonstrators were blocked by a group of police in the street between them and the church."Where do you want us to go?" the video shows Scott yelling out to police, some in riot gear. Three minutes later an officer approaches Scott."Ma'am is your phone recording?" the officer said."Yes, it is," she replies."You might want to turn it off so it doesn't get broke, OK? Turn it off and put it in your pocket, okay? Alright, go ahead and turn it off and put it in your pocket, I'm trying to be as nice as I can," the officer says before the video cuts off.In a press conference Friday afternoon, LMPD Chief Robert Schroeder explained an "unlawful assembly" was declared because members of a protest group had started damaging property."Even though this was prior to curfew, it means people must disperse," he said."An extra responsibility" to fight for justiceScott beat a 34-year incumbent in 2016 to become the first Black woman in nearly 20 years to serve in Kentucky's legislature. She says she's a certified anti-racism trainer and has a background in community organizing and civic engagement."That's who I am at core, so it's natural," she says about protesting, but the 48-year-old says she had never been arrested before Thursday night."I actively tried never to be in that position," she said. When asked if she regrets getting arrested with her daughter Thursday night, she said, "Absolutely not."Thursday wasn't the first time Scott and Ashanti, a McConnell Scholar at the University of Louisville, protested together.Scott said the two came out May 29, when outcry over the shooting reached a boiling point. Gunfire erupted during protests in Louisville and audio was released of Taylor's boyfriend's call to 911 the night she was killed."That's when I decided to dedicate my everything to seek justice for her, and with Breonna's mother," Scott said.On Wednesday it was announced the grand jury would not indict any LMPD officers for the death of Breonna Taylor. Instead, one officer who allegedly fired shots into her apartment was indicted on first-degree wanton endangerment charges, because some of the shots went into a neighboring apartment."I was, I am heartbroken, disappointed but not surprised," she said when asked about the Jefferson County grand jury's decision. "It's just very clear justice was not served for Breonna Taylor, her family and the community.""The real heartbreaking thing is my daughter said, 'Mom, I wanted to be an EMT to help people and see things on the ground level but now I don't know that's the case, because being an EMT didn't save Breonna Taylor."Scott plans to continue protesting."I'm a mom, I've communicated with Tamika Palmer, Breonna's mother, and I have the responsibility as a woman, a Black woman, a mother, to keep the fight going," she said.Scott spoke with CNN before joining Taylor's family, their attorneys and social activists in a news conference that called for the attorney general to release documents related to his office's investigation into the case."This is just the beginning of our work moving from protest to politics," she told CNN.(CNN)Breonna Taylor's family says they're heartbroken and outraged following the Kentucky attorney general's announcement not to charge the officers in the killing of the 26-year-old aspiring nurse."I was reassured Wednesday of why I have no faith in the legal system, in the police, in the law -- that are not made to protect us Black and Brown people," Tamika Palmer, Taylor's mother, wrote in a letter that was read out loud in a news conference Friday.Wednesday's announcement sparked public outrage and reignited protests that remain ongoing in Louisville and across the country. Before that, crowds gathered for months in Louisville to call for the arrests of the three officers involved.But the investigations in Taylor's case are far from over, and family attorneys say they're not giving up hopes for justice.The FBI announced in May it was investigating the circumstances surrounding Taylor's death and said this week that work continued "beyond the state charges announced." The agency has previously said it is taking a "fresh look" at all the evidence and interviewing witnesses as well as examining all the evidence.Family attorney Ben Crump says he hopes the federal investigation "finally gets justice for Bre and her family."His statement has been echoed by family attorney Lonita Baker, who also says she hasn't given up on state charges."We do hope there are federal civil rights violation charges brought as well. But again, we're not giving up on state level manslaughter or murder charges in the case of Breonna Taylor," Baker said. "We think they're warranted here, there's sufficient probable cause."Ongoing demonstrationsProtesters across the US have also echoed continued calls for justice following Wednesday's announcement.Friday marked the third night of demonstrations in Louisville since the attorney general's announcement and Taylor's family members -- including her mother -- joined the evening protest.As Palmer walked with the crowd, Taylor's aunt and several other women held a banner at the front of the march bearing the words "Justice for Breonna."At least 23 people were arrested Friday, according to Louisville Metro Police Department spokesperson Sgt. Lamont Washington. On Thursday, among two dozen people arrested during the demonstrations was Kentucky state Rep. Attica Scott, the state's only Black female legislator.Protests continued Friday in cities including Los Angeles, New York City and Atlanta."We're just demanding that police have more accountability," Qri Montague, co-chair of the People's Uprising, who helped organize a rally in Atlanta Friday, told CNN affiliate WSB.Calls for grand jury transcripts to be releasedMeanwhile, Crump, the family attorney, has called on the Kentucky attorney general to release the proceeding transcripts of the grand jury, who declined to charge the three Louisville police officers with Taylor's killing.Crump said he and Taylor's family were confused as to what Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron presented to the grand jury."Did he present any evidence on Breonna Taylor's behalf, or did he make a unilateral decision to put his thumb on the scales of justice to help try to exonerate and justify (the killing) by these police officers?" Crump said.On Friday night, Baker also called on the attorney general to be "straight forward," saying he "dodged" questions during his news conference earlier this week on whether he presented charges in connection to Taylor's killing."Or did his office make the unilateral decision not to charge these officers with anything related to Breonna Taylor?" Baker said."Because that's two different things, and if it did not go before grand jury, that's a true travesty of justice and we would demand that a special prosecutor be appointed in that case."What led to Taylor's deathIn March, then-Det. Brett Hankison, Sgt. John Mattingly and Det. Myles Cosgrove executed a search warrant on Taylor's home amid a months-long investigation that focused on her ex-boyfriend -- who was not at Taylor's apartment.He later told a Kentucky newspaper police used misleading and wrong information to obtain that warrant.When officers arrived at the apartment, Taylor was sleeping next to her current boyfriend, Kenneth Walker III. He told investigators they both heard a noise and got up and walked to the door, where police forced entry into the home.Walker said he fired one shot. Mattingly was shot in the leg, the attorney general said Wednesday.Hankison was accused by his own department of blindly firing 10 bullets into Taylor's apartment from an outdoor patio. He was fired in June, the Louisville police chief said, and is appealing his termination.Cameron said the officers were "justified in their use of force" because Taylor's boyfriend fired first.Walker was unharmed but Taylor was shot multiple times and died in the shooting.No drugs were found in the apartment and there is no police body camera footage of the incident.Hankison was charged with three first-degree wanton endangerment charges, pertaining to his blindly firing shots that penetrated the walls of a neighbor's apartment, the state attorney general said. There is "no conclusive evidence" any of those bullets hit Taylor, Cameron said.CNN's Jason Hanna, Mallika Kallingal, Steve Almasy, Sheena Jones and Elizabeth Joseph contributed to this report.(CNN)If you're a fearless Floridian looking for a new gig, this opening might be right up your alley: nuisance alligator trapping.Applicants for the position of "nuisance alligator trapper" are being solicited by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission's Division of Hunting and Game Management.According to the state's FWC website, the initiative is part of its Statewide Nuisance Alligator Program, otherwise known as SNAP, that contracts with private individuals to lawfully respond to and remove "specific nuisance alligators."The job is not full-time, however, and compensation is not necessarily what you'd expect."Nuisance alligator trappers are primarily compensated by their marketing and sale of alligator products (hides and meat) from nuisance alligators taken," the FWC said. "Trappers also may receive a small expense reimbursement from the FWC for each alligator taken."Snares and hooks not providedThe FWC emphasizes that income earned from being a nuisance alligator trapper may be insufficient to fully support an individual or family, adding that most trappers have additional sources of income.In other words, you probably won't get rich from helping Florida reduce its population of surplus alligators.In order to apply, the Florida FWC asks that the applicant:Be able to supply any equipment necessary to take alligators (truck, boat, snares, hooks, etc).
Have a record of adherence to fish and wildlife regulations and have no criminal history.
Assume personal liability for health, welfare and safety of themselves and their trapping agents.Florida also asks the successful applicant to project a positive image to the public and media, which should be a piece of cake for any recreational alligator hunter, no?Alligators and human interactionIt's no secret that Florida is home to some of the largest populations of American alligators in the United States, often living in close proximity to humans.The Florida FWC's call for nuisance alligator trappers coincides with recent alligator attacks, including an attack on a Florida woman who was trimming trees, and who suffered major injuries. The alligator in this case was caught by a licensed alligator trapper and brought to an alligator farm.In July, a family came across a 9-foot alligator with missing limbs on their doorstep. In April, officials warned motorists of aggressive alligators during mating season. Last year, alligators were caught on tape climbing fences and swimming on roads across the state."FWC places the highest priority on public safety and administers a Statewide Nuisance Alligator Program," FWC said in a statement to CNN. "The goal of SNAP is to proactively address alligator threats in developed areas, while conserving alligators in areas where they naturally occur."In other words, alligators are just part of life in the Sunshine state, but some mitigation is required, in addition to respect for the animals' natural habitat. And that's where the "nuisance alligator trapper" comes in.CNN's Alaa Elassar contributed to this reporting.(CNN)Nearly 100,000 Pacific Gas and Electric customers may lose power over fire danger in California ahead of a weekend that could bring record-breaking heat.PG&E says it's planning to shut off power starting Sunday morning to prevent electrical equipment from sparking a wildfire as strong winds and high temperatures are expected. Power may not return until Monday.Firefighters throughout the state are still battling 25 major wildfires, some of which have been burning for more than a month. About six counties currently face evacuation orders in the historic fire season that has claimed more than two dozen lives and scorched millions of acres.The potential power shutoffs will affect about 96,876 customers and include counties in the San Francisco Bay Area. Approximately 300,000 people would likely be affected by the potential shutoff, based on Census data.Customers in portions of Alpine, Amador, Butte, Calaveras, El Dorado, Kern, Lake, Napa, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Shasta, Sierra, Tehama and Yuba counties are being notified, according to the statement.Public Safety Power Shutoffs are implemented by PG&E when high temperatures, extreme dryness, and record-high winds create high fire-risk conditions.Threat to forestsMeanwhile, at least half of the National Forests in California will remain closed because of the threat of wildfires, according to the Forest Service. All 18 of California's National Forests have been closed since September 9 because of the fires.With another heat wave forecast, the National Weather Service is warning that high winds could combine with "critically dry conditions" that could lead to rapid wildfire spread. A red flag warning has been issued from the Bay Area nearly to the Oregon border."Continued closures are based on extreme fire conditions, critical limitations of firefighting resources, and to provide for firefighter and public safety," said Randy Moore, Regional Forester for the USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Region.For those areas that do open to visitors, no campfires or use of stoves will be permitted. "We understand how important access to the National Forests is to our visitors. Our aim is to prevent any new fires on the landscape," Moore added.(CNN)A women's group is hosting a virtual relay race to highlight the civil rights movement and help increase Black voter turnout for the 2020 presidential election.Ten thousand people -- of all genders, sexualities and races -- are participating in the Womxn Run the Vote virtual relay race that began Monday and runs through Sunday. The event was organized by Run 4 All Women, a New York-based group that empowers women through fitness to be the change they want to see in the world."Everyone was invited to participate, but this event is focused on women, specifically women of color," Alison Désir, who founded the group, told CNN. "Women have the power to transform communities. You often hear when a Black woman votes, the whole community votes, just because of how women tend to be transformational leaders who bring people with them."Désir, herself a Black woman, said the race was inspired by the 1977 torch relay, when over 2,000 women ran 2,612 miles across the United States to highlight the movement for women's rights.This time, the race will highlight the movement for racial equality. The virtual course takes participants from Atlanta to Washington DC, where they'll stop at key sites along the way to learn about the civil rights movement.For example, at the 580-mile mark, runners will find themselves at the Virginia Civil Rights Memorial, which commemorates protests that helped put an end to school segregation.The race includes 667 teams of 15 to 20 people apiece, with each team completing the 680 virtual miles. Participants can choose from more than 75 activities, including running, cycling, gardening, or strength training, which they can complete wherever they are in the county.Participants log their miles on Racery, an online race platform that tracks progress and shows them the civil rights sites they reach.Run 4 All Women made the relay race virtual to ensure that it's accessible and inclusive to all people, as well to maintain social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic. The "x" in the event's name symbolizes its inclusivity, Désir said.The race has raised more than $260,000, with a portion of the proceeds going to Black Voters Matter, which works to increase voter registration and advocates for policies to expand voting rights and access in predominantly Black communities."Not only are we excited, but we are so inspired that these women were able to put on their sneakers and run to raise money for our work which will help with voter registration and voter mobilization in the next few weeks," Black Voters Matter founder LaTosha Brown told CNN."The love these women have showed us why we need more women in leadership. Women are going to lead the way and transform our country."This weekly column will turn into a CNN newsletter later this year.

Already reeling from the implications of what the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg means for the future of civil rights in America, we had to sit with the rage over the lack of charges in Breonna Taylor's death.But there were some moments of hope. Zendaya's moving speech at the Emmys made us proud. Plus, recommendations: Rolling Stone's new list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" and, on Netflix, "Atlantique."CNN legal analyst Joan Biskupic joins this week's culture conversation as we discuss Ginsburg's legacy on race and criminal justice.Q: Often, we hear about Ruth Bader Ginsburg as a feminist icon. Could you tell us a bit about some of the highlights from her career on race? We're thinking of cases like Jackson v. Hobbs and Shelby County v. Holder.Biskupic: Ruth Bader Ginsburg was known for her women's rights emphasis, but in recent years she became the voice of broader civil rights, particularly after she became the senior justice on the left in 2010 and took control in assigning opinions for the liberal wing. Liberals were often in dissent on racial civil rights, and no decision demonstrates that more, or RBG's sentiment more, than the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder.In that case, the conservative Roberts majority invalidated a section of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that required states with a history of discrimination, mostly in the South, to pre-clear any proposed change in their election rules with federal officials. The majority said that the requirement was outdated and that things had changed in the South."Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes," Ginsburg responded, joined by her liberal colleagues, "is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet."She cited several examples of contemporary voter discrimination. In the case from Shelby County, Alabama, she highlighted "Alabama's sorry history" of voting rights violations and reminded readers that that the state "is home to Selma, site of the 'Bloody Sunday' beatings of civil-rights demonstrators that served as the catalyst for the VRA's enactment." She then quoted Martin Luther King Jr., who had said, "The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice." And Ginsburg concluded: "History has proven King right. The sad irony of today's decision lies in its utter failure to grasp why the Voting Rights Act has proven effective."Q: Where did Ginsburg stand on criminal justice?Biskupic: On criminal cases, Ginsburg's record is mixed. She was not a liberal in the mold of Justices William Brennan (1956-1990) or Thurgood Marshall (1967-1991), who were more inclined to side with criminal defendants against law enforcement and who opposed capital punishment. On today's court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor is more reliably in favor of defendants' rights.Yet Ginsburg led the left as it voted against some of the Roberts Court's strongest decisions cutting back on criminal-rights milestones of the 1960s and 1970s.One recent case I will mention, in which RBG wrote alone, relates to concerns about police conduct. The 2018 case, District of Columbia v. Wesby, required the court to revisit its decision in Whren v. United States, which enhanced police power for traffic stops and found an officer's motivation irrelevant when deciding whether a stop or arrest was lawful.In the 2018 DC v. Wesby case, Justice Ginsburg wrote a solo concurrence saying, "The Court's jurisprudence, I am concerned, sets the balance too heavily in favor of police unaccountability to the detriment of Fourth Amendment protection. ... I would leave open, for reexamination in a future case, whether a police officer's reason for acting, in at least some circumstances, should factor into the Fourth Amendment inquiry."But I should emphasize that the 1996 Whren was unanimous, and no other justice joined Ginsburg's concurrence in the 2018 Wesby.Q: Any thoughts on what Ginsburg's death might mean for these issues?Biskupic: I do not expect any shift to the left in this area of the law, particularly now that Ginsburg would be succeeded by an appointee of President Donald Trump.For further reading, check out professor and author Peniel Joseph's take on "How to remember the 'Notorious RBG,'" a piece in which he unpacks the justice's Colin Kaepernick comments and the rest of her legacy in the context of today.Around the officeFor people across the country, one of this week's defining feelings has been grief and anger.On Wednesday, more than six months after Breonna Taylor was shot and killed in a flawed police raid, a grand jury indicted only one of the three officers involved on first-degree wanton endangerment charges.In other words, no officer was charged directly with Taylor's death."We lost a beautiful woman in Breonna," NBA star LeBron James said on Thursday. "We want justice no matter how long it takes, even though it's been so many days, so many hours, so many minutes for her family, for her community."CNN's Madeline Holcombe, Steve Almasy and Dakin Andone reported on the outrage gripping the country."From Louisville to Los Angeles, Atlanta and New York, masses of people congregated to protest the decision. Police in Portland declared protests outside the justice center there a riot," our colleagues wrote.As Sadiqa Reynolds, the president and CEO of the Louisville Urban League, told them, "We somehow got our hopes up in this case. We wanted to believe the system would change."Worth another look: Zendaya's moment at the EmmysWhy we're excited: On Sunday, for her role on HBO's "Euphoria," 24-year-old Zendaya became the youngest Emmy winner for best lead actress in a drama.But her history-making win was notable for another reason, too."I just want to say that there is hope in the young people out there," Zendaya said, referring to Black Lives Matter protesters. "And I just want to say to all our peers out there doing the work in the streets: I see you, I admire you, I thank you."It was a quick comment packed with a lot of meaning.Even as Zendaya was overcome with, well, euphoria over her award, she never lost sight of the fact that the world outside is wrestling with the very opposite.Recommended for your eyes and earsBrandon recommends: Rolling Stone's '500 Greatest Albums of All Time'Sometimes, it's nice to pause for music that makes you happy, especially when reality is constantly making you feel queasy.Rolling Stone's new list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time" has a lot of music that makes me happy.As Leah wrote in a piece earlier this week, the updated list has come a long way since its 2003 debut, which heavily featured rock music.To me, what's so thrilling about the new Rolling Stone canon is how prominently Black artists feature among its upper ranks -- albums by Black artists fill four of the top 10 spots.Of the new top albums, Lauryn Hill's colossal 1998 record, "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill," which hovers at No. 10, is one of my absolute favorites. On it, the eminent emcee parses everything from motherhood to racial injustice to pride in one's origins.Hill grants herself, and Black women more generally, a kind of rarely seen complexity."This is a very sexist industry," the singer told Essence magazine in 1998. "They'll never throw the 'genius' title to a sister."In its own small way, the new Rolling Stone list feels like just the rejoinder to Hill's comments that fans have been waiting for.Leah recommends: "Atlantique," directed by Mati Diop, on NetflixIn the first 30 minutes of "Atlantique," a French film now on Netflix, Souleiman (Ibrahima Traoré) has left Dakar, Senegal, for Spain. He and his fellow workers are searching for better economic opportunities after a construction tycoon cheats them of their wages.No one on his boat survives. But the camera doesn't follow their migrant story, instead staying with Ada (Mame Bineta Sane), Souleiman's lover, left seemingly alone. That is, until the men who left, including Souleiman, return as ghosts -- terrorizing the construction tycoons who cheated them.But it's not the ghosts that spark the true terror in "Atlantique" -- even with their glowing, pupil-less eyes and scratchy voices. The ghosts represent life lost, sure, but they also represent a reversal of power, as they eventually (spoiler alert) take back the money they're owed. Some might argue that the ghosts represent hope.It's the economic hardships and the pain of love lost that do the real haunting in "Atlantique," more than any ghost could.As we approach October, and everywhere I turn is filled with Halloween decor, I look back on the last few months in shock at the number of loved ones we've lost in the US -- to Covid-19, to racism -- and at our own stark economic disparities. These things, like in "Atlantique," are what has haunted me and many people I love these past few months. And looking ahead to Halloween, I think: What could be scarier than the world we are already in?(CNN)It's official, all the top-tier college football conferences are now planning to play this fall.The Mid-American Conference (MAC) and Mountain West Conference (MWC) were the latest two schools this week to announce an altered season. This means that all 10 conferences in NCAA's Football Bowl Subdivision -- the top tier of college football -- now plans to play football this fall.The MAC, which suspended fall sports on August 8, announced Friday its plans to start a six-game, conference-only football season on November 4. The conference said it is not planning to allow general public attendance or tailgating at football games this season."The Conference will implement a COVID-19 testing program requiring four antigen tests per week with all positive tests needing confirmation with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test," the MAC said in a news release. "Any student athlete with a positive test will enter a cardiac screening protocol."The MWC, which indefinitely postponed fall sports on August 10, announced Thursday its plans for an eight-game football season on October 24. The league plans to allow each member institution to make its own decision on fan attendance in accordance with state, county and local guidelines."Our student-athletes have voiced their desire to compete, and it is the Board's shared opinion that football can be conducted with appropriate mitigation," said Dr. Mary Papazian, San José State University President and Chair of the MWC Board of Directors.All the Power Five conferences -- SEC, ACC, Big 12, Pac-12 and Big Ten -- have announced plans to play this season. The Pac-12 announced Thursday they'd begin play on November 6.The ACC and Big 12 have already restarted play, with the SEC set to follow Saturday. The Big Ten is scheduled to begin play the weekend of October 23 and 24.CNN's Leah Asmelash and Jill Martin contributed to this report.(CNN)Moments after her husband jumped into the turquoise waters of the Florida Keys, Margot Dukes-Eddy saw a shark fin and blood around the area where he had entered the water. Without hesitation, Dukes-Eddy, who is pregnant, leaped into the water and pulled him to safety.On a family vacation in Florida last week, the Atlanta-based couple, accompanied by Duke-Eddy's parents, sister and her sister's boyfriend, decided to spend the day swimming and snorkeling aboard a private 20-foot motorboat, according to the Miami Herald who first reported the story.The family set out to explore the marine life of the Sombrero Reef in the Florida Keys, the 125-mile-long chain of islands that begins just south of Miami.With several other people from nearby boats already swimming in the water, 30-year-old Andrew Eddy didn't hesitate to jump in. Almost immediately after entering the water, a shark -- described by witnesses as an 8- to 10-foot bull shark -- slammed into Eddy and latched onto his shoulder, according to witnesses.Dukes-Eddy, watching from the boat, immediately sprang into action.As Deputy Christopher Aguanno wrote in his report for the Monroe County Sheriff's Office, she "saw the shark's dorsal fin and then blood filling the water," and "without hesitation, dove into the water and pulled Eddy to the safety of the boat."Eddy was immediately taken to Sombrero Beach and then airlifted to a nearby hospital in Miami where the injury to his shoulder was deemed severe, according to the Monroe County Sheriff's Office.Dukes-Eddy has not responded to a request for comment.There was no one "fishing or chumming" the water where the group was snorkeling and there were no other reported injuries, Aguanno confirmed.Monroe County, located around 160 miles southwest of Miami, has had only 17 confirmed and unprovoked shark attacks since 1882, according to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack File -- making this case all the more surprising.
